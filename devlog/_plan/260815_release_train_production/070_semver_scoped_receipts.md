# 070 — Scoped receipt requirements, and closing the holes the audit found

Status: PLANNED — work-phase wp7 (rewritten after the A gate)

## The trigger

v0.2.0-beta.1 is published, but the releases page still shows **v0.1.0 as Latest**,
because GitHub never promotes a prerelease. To a visitor nothing shipped. Cutting a
stable `0.2.0` is blocked by our own gate:

```text
release verify: NOT READY — 9 blocker(s):
  - activation-baseline deferred: target: MLB 1.0, not required for 0.2.x
  ... 8 more, identical shape
```

Every reason already says *not required for 0.2.x*. The prose knows; the schema
cannot express it, so a 1.0-scoped receipt blocks a 0.2 release.

## What the audit found underneath

Auditing that fix surfaced three defects in **already-shipped** code, one of which
makes a claim I previously made too strong. Verified against `dist/release-gate.js`:

```text
EMPTY RECEIPT ARRAY on a 1.0.0 candidate:
  schemaErrors: []
  gate       : {"ready":true,"blockers":[]}
```

`isReleaseReady` only inspects receipts that *happen to exist*. A candidate with
`receipts: []` passes. So "the gate refuses a release without its evidence" was true
only for receipts the manifest chose to list. Closing this is now part of this phase,
not a follow-up.

And the workflow's prerelease classifier is a substring test:

```text
case $VERSION in *-*)   =>   prerelease
  0.2.0-beta.1            -> prerelease=true    correct
  1.0.0                   -> prerelease=false   correct
  1.0.0+build-with-hyphen -> prerelease=true    WRONG — build metadata, still stable
  1.0.0-rc.1              -> prerelease=true    correct as a label, but see below
```

A stable `1.0.0+build-with-hyphen` would receive `--allow-deferred` and could skip
all nine MLB receipts.

## Design

### 1. Scope, expressed as a policy in code — not as manifest data

`RequiredReceipt` gains `requiredFrom?: string`, and the nine MLB receipts declare
`requiredFrom: "1.0.0"`. Critically, the manifest copy is **not** trusted: `verify`
reads the canonical policy from `RECEIPT_POLICY` (name → `{requiredFrom}`) in
`release-gate.ts` and rejects any manifest whose receipt disagrees with it.

Otherwise a hand-written `--candidate` file could carry
`requiredFrom: "9999.0.0"` and excuse its own evidence. No CLI setter is added.

### 2. Obligation threshold, not SemVer precedence

A receipt is **due** when the candidate's `major.minor.patch` core is >= the
`requiredFrom` core. Prerelease identifiers are deliberately ignored **for this
decision**:

| Candidate | vs `1.0.0` | 1.0 receipts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0.2.0-beta.1` | core `0.2.0` < `1.0.0` | not due |
| `0.2.0` | `<` | not due |
| `0.9.0` / `0.10.0` | numeric, `0.10.0 > 0.9.0` | not due |
| **`1.0.0-rc.1`** | core `1.0.0` >= `1.0.0` | **DUE — blocks** |
| `1.0.0` | `>=` | due |
| `1.0.0+build` | metadata ignored | due |
| malformed / absent | — | **fail closed**: invalid version is a blocker |

The `1.0.0-rc.1` row is the whole reason this is a threshold rather than ordinary
precedence. Under SemVer `1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0`, so a naive comparison would let a 1.0
release candidate skip exactly the evidence 1.0 is defined by. An rc of 1.0 is part
of the 1.0 line and owes 1.0 evidence.

### 3. The canonical receipt set is required

`validateCandidateManifest` gains a completeness check: the manifest's receipt names
must equal `TRAIN_RECEIPT_NAMES ∪ MLB_RECEIPT_NAMES` exactly — no omissions, no
duplicates, no unknown names. `receipts: []` becomes a validation failure instead of
a pass.

### 4. One SemVer parser, shared with the workflow

`parseVersion` is exported and `release.yml` uses it instead of the `*-*` glob:

```bash
node bin/codexclaw.mjs release classify --version "$VERSION"   # prints: stable | prerelease
```

That value drives both `--allow-deferred` and `gh release create --prerelease`, so the
label on GitHub and the gate's leniency can never disagree.

### 5. The payload must not lie about its own version

The repo still declares `0.2.0-beta.1` in `package.json`, the plugin manifest, eight
component packages and `inventory.json`. Publishing `v0.2.0` from that tree would ship
an archive labelled beta. wp8 bumps them, and `release.yml` gains an assertion that
the embedded versions equal the release version before it publishes.

## Not doing: relabel the existing beta

`gh release edit v0.2.0-beta.1 --prerelease=false --make-latest` would flip the page
today. Rejected: the tag and every embedded version string say `0.2.0-beta.1`, so
marking it the stable current release would misrepresent the artifact — the same
class of dishonesty this whole unit exists to remove. A correctly versioned `0.2.0`
is the honest path.

## PLAN-FIELD-CHAIN-01 — `requiredFrom`

| Stage | Path |
| --- | --- |
| creation | `RECEIPT_POLICY` + `MLB_1_0_RECEIPTS` literals; `release init` copies them |
| serialization | receipt object in the candidate JSON |
| validation | must parse **and** equal `RECEIPT_POLICY[name].requiredFrom` |
| consumers | `isReleaseReady` due-check only |

`verify --json` does **not** emit receipts, so it is not a consumer — the earlier draft
claimed it was, which was wrong.

`TRAIN_RECEIPTS` carry no `requiredFrom`: due for every release, always.

## File change map

| Path | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `release-gate.ts` | `requiredFrom`; `parseVersion`/`compareCore`/`isPrerelease`; `RECEIPT_POLICY`; completeness + policy-match validation; due-check; invalid version blocks |
| `release-cli.ts` | `classify` verb; no `--required-from` setter |
| `release-gate.test.ts` | threshold table, empty/duplicate/unknown/forged receipts, malformed version |
| `release-cli.test.ts` | `init` seeds policy; 0.2.0 verifies with no flag; 1.0.0 does not |
| `release.yml` | use `classify`; assert embedded versions match |

## Accept criteria

| # | Criterion | Activation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1.0-scoped deferral does not block 0.2.0 | complete candidate, no flag → `READY` |
| 2 | the same receipts block `1.0.0` | same candidate at 1.0.0, no flag → blocked, named |
| 3 | **`1.0.0-rc.1` also blocks** | rc candidate → blocked |
| 4 | `receipts: []` is rejected | validation error, not `ready:true` |
| 5 | forged `requiredFrom` rejected | `9999.0.0` on a due receipt → policy-mismatch error |
| 6 | a due deferral still blocks | deferred train receipt → blocked |
| 7 | `missing` never scope-excused | MLB receipt `missing` on 0.2.0 → blocked |
| 8 | classifier correct | `1.0.0+build-with-hyphen` → `stable`; `1.0.0-rc.1` → `prerelease` |
| 9 | no regression | existing 33 release tests + `npm test` green |

Criteria 2, 3 and 4 are load-bearing: if any stops blocking, the change removed the
guarantee instead of scoping it.

## `--allow-deferred` does not reach a due receipt (A-gate r2 #1)

The rewrite made `1.0.0-rc.1` *due*, then classified it `prerelease` and handed it
`--allow-deferred` — which today skips **every** deferred receipt unconditionally
(`release-gate.ts`: `if (options.allowDeferred) continue;`). The two rules would have
cancelled out and the 1.0 line would still ship without its evidence.

Precedence is now explicit:

```text
deferred receipt
  ├─ requiredFrom set AND candidate core < requiredFrom core  -> not due, skipped (scope)
  └─ otherwise                                                -> DUE, blocks
                                                                 even with --allow-deferred
```

So `--allow-deferred` now has **no effect on the gate at all**, and that is the chosen
policy rather than an accident (A-gate r3 #1: the previous wording left it both
effective and ineffective, which is not implementable). The two branches cover every
receipt:

- below its `requiredFrom` -> skipped automatically, no flag needed
- at or above it, or unscoped -> due, blocks, and no flag waives it

The flag is retained in the CLI and recorded on the manifest purely as **provenance**:
it states that the operator asked to ship leniently, which is worth having in the
published artifact even when the gate ignored the request. Train receipts are
unscoped and therefore always due — which is what kept the wp3 missing-receipt path
firing, and still does.

Criterion 6 is amended to assert both flag states: a due deferral blocks with AND
without `--allow-deferred`.

Criterion 3 is amended to run **with** `allowDeferred: true`, and a chain test walks
the real workflow path: `classify 1.0.0-rc.1` → `prerelease` → `verify --allow-deferred`
→ blocked, naming the nine receipts.

## Version-surface assertion, stated precisely (A-gate r2 #2)

"Embedded versions equal the release version" was too literal: `plugin.json` carries
`+codex.<timestamp>` build metadata by design (050), so `0.2.0+codex.20260815...`
would never string-equal `0.2.0` and the legitimate release would be impossible.

The assertion compares **SemVer core + prerelease**, ignoring build metadata:

| Surface | Must equal | Metadata |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `package.json` | `0.2.0` exactly | none allowed |
| 8 component `package.json` | `0.2.0` exactly | none allowed |
| `plugin.json` | core+prerelease `0.2.0` | `+codex.<stamp>` permitted |
| `inventory.json` `plugin.*Version` | mirrors the two above | as above |

wp8 file surfaces, previously missing from the map:
`package.json`, `plugins/codexclaw/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`,
`plugins/codexclaw/components/*/package.json`, `plugins/codexclaw/inventory.json`,
`CHANGELOG.md`.

Added acceptance criteria:

| # | Criterion | Activation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | a correctly bumped 0.2.0 tree passes the assertion | run it post-bump → exit 0 |
| 11 | a stale beta surface fails it | leave one component at `0.2.0-beta.1` → non-zero, naming the file |
| 12 | build metadata does not fail the assertion | `plugin.json` `0.2.0+codex.<stamp>` → passes |

Round 2 also confirmed the closures hold: the core threshold has no 1.0-line
exemption (`alpha`/`rc`/stable/patch/build variants all core `>= 1.0.0`); exact canonical
names close the empty-array, omission, duplicate and unknown-name holes; and
`RECEIPT_POLICY` equality prevents `requiredFrom` forgery despite arbitrary JSON input.

## A-gate round 1 (FAIL — 6 blockers, all folded)

| # | Sev | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | High | folded — `*-*` glob misclassifies `1.0.0+build-with-hyphen` as prerelease, which would hand it `--allow-deferred`. Replaced by a shared `classify` verb driving both the flag and the GitHub label. |
| 2 | High | folded — obligation is now a **core-version threshold**, so `1.0.0-rc.1` owes 1.0 evidence. Ordinary SemVer precedence would have exempted it. |
| 3 | High | folded — `requiredFrom` is canonical in `RECEIPT_POLICY` and a manifest that disagrees is rejected, so a hand-written candidate cannot excuse itself. |
| 4 | High | folded — **pre-existing hole**, reproduced: an empty receipt array verified `ready:true` on a 1.0.0 candidate. Validation now requires the exact canonical set. |
| 5 | High | folded — wp8 bumps every embedded version and `release.yml` asserts they match before publishing. |
| 6 | Medium | folded — `verify --json` removed from the chain (it emits no receipts), criterion 5's inverted wording fixed, negative cases added. |

Also recorded from the same round: this repo is `private: true` with no `npm publish`,
so "deploy" here means the GitHub Release payload, not a package registry.
