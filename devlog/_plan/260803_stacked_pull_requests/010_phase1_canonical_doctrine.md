# 010 — Phase 1: Canonical `DEV-STACK-*` doctrine in `dev`

Unit: `260803_stacked_pull_requests` · Work-phase: WP2 · Depends on: none (foundation).
Deliverable: the single normative definition site for stacked PRs plus its ownership row.
Independently verifiable: `npm run gate` + `npm test` green, and `rg "DEV-STACK-"` shows
exactly one definition site with pointer-shaped mentions everywhere else.

## Scope

IN: `plugins/codexclaw/skills/dev/references/stacked-prs.md` (NEW),
`plugins/codexclaw/skills/dev/SKILL.md` (MODIFY, §5 area + §Modular-reference table row),
`plugins/codexclaw/skills/dev/references/skill-ownership.md` (MODIFY, one row).

OUT: every other skill (WP3 owns those), frontmatter/keywords (WP4), CLI/hooks.

## Rule ids introduced

| Id | Class | One-line meaning |
|----|-------|------------------|
| `DEV-STACK-01` | DEFAULT | When dependent work exceeds one reviewable diff, publish it as a bottom-up stack instead of one large PR or a set of order-less PRs. |
| `DEV-STACK-02` | STRICT | Editing any layer requires cascading the rebase to every layer above it before pushing; a stale upper base is a defect, not a formatting nit. |
| `DEV-STACK-03` | DEFAULT | Each layer must stand alone: own thesis, own build, own tests; a layer that cannot be reviewed without the one above it is mis-sliced. |
| `DEV-STACK-04` | ESCALATE | Merging is bottom-up and remains user-authorized; agents never merge, never force-push without `--force-with-lease`, never reorder a stack that has merged layers. |
| `DEV-STACK-05` | DEFAULT | Reviewing a layer: review only its own diff, judge it standalone, verify its base ref, re-check findings after a force-push. Approving a layer is not approval to merge. |

`DEV-STACK-05` lives here rather than in `dev-code-reviewer` (A-gate round 2, blocker 2):
review mechanics for stacks are stack semantics, so they belong to the stack owner. The
reviewer skill gets a trigger + pointer only.

## NEW — `plugins/codexclaw/skills/dev/references/stacked-prs.md`

Full body (write verbatim):

```markdown
# Stacked Pull Requests (canonical — `DEV-STACK-*`)

Canonical owner: `dev`. Other skills carry pointer stubs only (see
`references/skill-ownership.md`). Rules here are tool-agnostic: the portable model first,
CLI recipes second.

## The model

A **stack** is an ordered chain of branches. The **bottom** branch is based on trunk
(usually `main`); every branch above is based on the branch below it. Each branch gets its
own PR whose base is the branch below, so each PR's diff shows only that layer.

```
feature/ui        → PR #3 (base: feature/api)     ← top
feature/api       → PR #2 (base: feature/schema)
feature/schema    → PR #1 (base: main)            ← bottom
──────────────────  main (trunk)
```

Four invariants hold across every stacking tool (GitHub `gh stack`, Graphite, Git Town,
plain git). Learn these, not a vendor's flags:

1. **The base ref is the dependency edge.** The chain is your phase map, made reviewable.
2. **Editing a lower layer invalidates every layer above it** — always cascade.
3. **Merging is bottom-up.** Out-of-order merges are the pathological case.
4. **Every layer must stand alone for review**: own thesis, own build, own tests.

## DEV-STACK-01 — When to stack (DEFAULT)

Stack when **all** of these hold:

- the work splits into 2+ parts with a real dependency order (later parts consume earlier
  parts' output), and
- shipping it as one PR would produce a diff too large to review in one sitting, and
- the lower parts are mergeable on their own — they do not need the upper parts to be
  correct or safe.

Codexclaw produces stack-shaped work by construction: a `cxc-pabcd` PHASE-SPLIT-01 phase
map is dependency-ordered (foundations → core → integration → hardening) and each phase
must close with something independently verifiable. That map **is** a stack plan; a
`cxc-loop` chain of work-phases under one goal is the same shape across cycles.

Do **not** stack when:

- the change is one cohesive thesis (splitting adds CI and review cost, buys nothing);
- the parts are independent — open parallel PRs off trunk instead, since a stack imposes a
  false merge order;
- the lower layer is speculative and likely to be rewritten (every rewrite re-cascades);
- you cannot name what each layer proves on its own (that is a slicing failure — fix the
  slice before opening anything).

**Depth (HEURISTIC — practitioner guidance, not a measured limit).** Aim for 2–4 layers
and think hard at 5. Community practice guides suggest each layer be reviewable in roughly
10–15 minutes and report stacks becoming unwieldy past about 4–5 layers; treat that as
experience, not a rule. What is certain: every layer is a separate fully gated PR with its
own review and its own CI, and every layer above an edit has to be re-stacked by hand or
by tool. If the map is longer, ship the bottom half, land it, then stack the rest.

**Slice by dependency, never by effort.** "Quick wins first" produces layers whose
dependency runs opposite to the merge order, so the stack cannot land bottom-up. This is
`cxc-pabcd` PHASE-SPLIT-01 applied to branches.

## DEV-STACK-02 — Cascading edits (STRICT)

When a lower layer changes, every layer above it is based on a commit that no longer
exists. Re-push the cascade before asking for review:

- Plain git (no extension): `git rebase --update-refs` force-updates any branch pointing
  at a commit inside the rebased range. Branches checked out in another worktree are not
  updated. Enable by default with `git config --global rebase.updateRefs true`; disable
  per-invocation with `--no-update-refs`.
- `gh stack rebase` fetches origin and cascades from trunk upward; if a layer's PR has
  already merged it switches to `--onto` mode automatically. Conflicts pause the run;
  resume with `--continue`, unwind everything with `--abort`. Scope with `--downstack` /
  `--upstack` / `--no-trunk`.
- Other tools (Graphite `gt restack`/`gt modify`, Git Town `git town sync`, `spr diff`)
  express the same cascade — read their own docs before using their flags.

After the cascade, publish with `git push --force-with-lease` (never bare `--force`) and
re-check each PR's base ref. A rebase rewrites the reviewed commits, so depending on
repository settings a force-push can invalidate existing review state and leave inline
comments attached to commits that no longer exist. Assume review state is stale after a
cascade: say what changed and re-request review rather than expecting prior approvals to
carry.

**Verification (STRICT):** a cascade is not done because the command exited 0. Confirm each
upper branch actually contains the new lower-layer commit (`git log --oneline
<lower>..<upper>` shows only that layer's commits) and that each PR's base ref still names
the branch below it.

## DEV-STACK-03 — Layer shape (DEFAULT)

Each layer:

- has one thesis, stated in its PR title;
- builds and passes its own tests at its own tip — do not defer a layer's tests upward;
- carries a stack map in its PR body so reviewers can navigate:

```markdown
**Stack** (merge bottom-up):
| # | PR | Layer | Review focus |
|---|----|-------|--------------|
| 3 | #103 | UI | integration only |
| 2 | #102 | API | endpoint behavior |
| 1 | #101 | schema ← you are here | migration + rollback |

Depends on #101. Review this PR's diff only.
```

Mid-stack layers are **not** lightly gated: on GitHub, branch protection such as CODEOWNERS
approval is enforced on every PR in the stack — including mid-stack PRs that do not target
the default branch — and CI configured for the default branch runs for all of them, not
just the bottom. Budget for that: a 5-layer stack is 5 fully gated PRs, not one.

## DEV-STACK-05 — Reviewing a layer (DEFAULT)

When you are reviewing one layer of a stack:

- **Review this layer's diff only.** Its base is the branch below, so the diff is already
  scoped to the layer. Do not re-litigate a lower layer's decisions here — comment on that
  layer's own PR.
- **Judge the layer standalone** (`DEV-STACK-03`). Does it build and pass its tests at its
  own tip? "Tests come in the next PR" is a blocking finding, not a courtesy.
- **Verify the base ref.** A layer whose base points at trunk instead of its parent, or
  whose branch lacks the parent's latest commits, is a stale cascade (`DEV-STACK-02`) —
  block until it is re-stacked.
- **Re-check your findings after a force-push.** A cascade rewrites commits, so confirm
  earlier findings and approvals survived rather than assuming they carried.
- **Approving a layer is not approval to merge the stack.** Merge order and authorization
  stay with `DEV-STACK-04`.

## DEV-STACK-04 — Merging and safety (ESCALATE)

- **Merge bottom-up.** On GitHub, merging the top PR brings every PR below it; merging a
  mid-stack PR merges everything below it while the PRs above stay open and re-target the
  stack's base automatically.
- **Merging stays user-authorized.** `DEV-GIT-PUSH-01` already gates pushing; merging a
  stack is a strictly larger external state change. Never merge, never enable auto-merge,
  and never bypass a queue on the agent's own initiative.
- **Never reorder or drop a layer that has already merged** — reconstruct forward instead.
- **Squash caution.** Squash merging collapses a PR's commits into one and does not
  preserve the originals. GitHub's own guidance is that squash merging works best for
  short-lived branches: if you keep working on the same head branch afterwards, later PRs
  can include commits already squashed into the base, making conflicts more likely and
  forcing you to resolve the same conflict more than once. In a stack, cascade immediately
  after any squash merge.
- **Required reviews interact with shared commits.** Under required reviews, collaborators
  cannot merge a PR while other open PRs have a head branch pointing at the same commit
  with pending or rejected reviews — a shape stacks produce easily. Resolve those first.
- Merge requirements for every PR in a GitHub stack are determined by the **bottom** PR's
  base branch.

## Tooling

You do not need an extension: `gh pr create --base <branch-below>` expresses the chain and
`git rebase --update-refs` maintains it. Pass `--base` explicitly for every layer: when it
is omitted, `gh` uses the `branch.<current>.gh-merge-base` config and, if that is unset,
the repository's default branch — so a layer can silently target trunk instead of its
parent.

GitHub's first-party extension is `gh stack` (`gh extension install github/gh-stack`,
requires `gh` v2.0+). Core verbs: `init`, `add`, `push`, `view`, `submit`, `rebase`,
`modify`; `up`/`down` navigate (up = away from trunk). Stack metadata lives in
`.git/gh-stack` (JSON, uncommitted) and it enables `git rerere` on init so conflict
resolutions replay across cascades. It also ships an agent-facing skill:
`gh skill install github/gh-stack`.

GitHub's native stacked-PR feature was in **public preview** as of 2026-08-03 — verify
current status before relying on preview-only behavior.

Sources for the behavioral claims above, all opened 2026-08-03: `git rebase` docs
(`--update-refs`), GitHub Docs "About stacked pull requests", "Pull request merges", and
"About protected branches", the `gh pr create` manual, and the `github/gh-stack` README.

## MODIFY — `plugins/codexclaw/skills/dev/SKILL.md`

### M1. Modular-reference table row (near line 91, the `logging` row block)

Add one row so the reference is discoverable from the routing table:

```diff
 | `logging` (CLI / scripts / libraries) | `dev` `references/logging.md` | What to emit and where; service instrumentation stays with `dev-backend` |
+| stacked pull requests (`DEV-STACK-*`) | `dev` `references/stacked-prs.md` | When to stack, cascade discipline, layer shape, bottom-up merge safety |
```

### M2. §5 Safety Rules — new bullet after `DEV-GIT-PUSH-01` (line ~406)

```diff
 - **Push requires explicit user approval (DEV-GIT-PUSH-01, ESCALATE)** — never `git push` without ...
+- **Stack dependent work instead of one oversized PR (DEV-STACK-01, DEFAULT)** — when a change splits into 2+ dependency-ordered parts and one PR would be too large to review, publish a bottom-up stack: each branch based on the one below, each PR's base pointing at its parent. Editing a lower layer means cascading the rebase to every layer above before pushing (`DEV-STACK-02`, STRICT). Merging a stack is bottom-up and stays user-authorized (`DEV-STACK-04`, ESCALATE). Canonical rules, depth guidance, anti-patterns, and tooling: `references/stacked-prs.md`.
```

Wording constraint: the bullet must NOT restate the reference body — it names the trigger,
the strict cascade duty, and the escalate boundary, then points. Duplication would violate
the family's single-owner rule and the reviewer checks for it.

## MODIFY — `plugins/codexclaw/skills/dev/references/skill-ownership.md`

Insert one row, adjacent to the other process/safety rows:

```diff
 | Pre-write search | `dev` §1.5 | `dev-code-reviewer` |
+| Stacked pull requests (`DEV-STACK-*`) | `dev` `references/stacked-prs.md` | `pabcd`, `loop`, `dev-code-reviewer`, `dev-devops` |
```

## Accept criteria (WP2)

1. `rg -n "DEV-STACK-0" plugins/codexclaw/skills` → definitions only in
   `dev/references/stacked-prs.md`; `dev/SKILL.md` mention is pointer-shaped.
2. `npm run gate` exits 0 (no forbidden-claims / status-sync / count drift).
3. `npm test` exits 0.
4. The reference states depth guidance, a do-not-stack list, and anti-patterns —
   criterion c4's "reader can decide when NOT to stack".
5. No claim in the reference is stated as fact from a `lead`- or `unverified`-status ledger
   row. The K15 depth heuristic ships explicitly labeled as practitioner guidance, and the
   K20 review-invalidation behavior ships hedged ("depending on repository settings").
   A-gate round 1 rejected an earlier draft for exactly this; see `001_audit_synthesis.md`.
6. No CI-rerun or "depth × cascades" arithmetic appears anywhere: the only CI statement is
   K4's verified one (every layer is a fully gated PR running default-branch checks).
   A-gate round 2 rejected a draft that kept the claim after dropping its citation.
7. `DEV-STACK-05` (review mechanics) is defined here, not in `dev-code-reviewer`.

## Activation scenario (C-ACTIVATION-GROUNDING-01)

This phase adds documentation, not a conditional code path — the "activation" is
routing/visibility, verified in WP4 by grepping the discovery surfaces an agent actually
reads (frontmatter keywords, ownership map, reference table) rather than by a runtime trace.

## WP2 A-gate: deltas between this plan and the landed file

A fresh reviewer audited the landed implementation against this doc and raised one High
and one Medium. Recorded here so the doc stays the SoT for what actually shipped.

**High — K15 leaked back in unhedged (ACCEPTED, fixed).** The landed anti-pattern table
row read "Deep stacks (>4–5 layers) | Rebase and reviewer-navigation cost grow faster than
the review benefit", asserting as canonical fact the exact threshold the Depth paragraph
~100 lines earlier had carefully labeled as practitioner experience. A hedge is only worth
what its weakest restatement says. The row now names the guidance as practitioner
experience, points back to Depth, and states only the mechanical cost (another gated PR,
another branch to re-stack). This is the third distinct instance of the same failure family
in this unit (round 1: lead-as-fact; round 2: citation laundering; here: hedge-defeating
restatement) — the pattern is that a claim's *status* has to travel with every copy of it.

**Medium — four deviations from "write verbatim" (ACCEPTED as plan amendments, not
reverted).** The reviewer is right that the landed file is not byte-identical to the body
prescribed above. Dispositions:

| Deviation | Disposition |
|---|---|
| §DEV-STACK-01 do-not-stack: "CI and review cost" → "review and CI surface" | Keep. The plan's phrasing edged toward the K17 cost-arithmetic the round-2 audit deleted; "surface" is the claim K4 supports. |
| Graphite command pair spacing (`gt restack` / `gt modify`) | Keep. Cosmetic. |
| Anti-pattern table added to the reference | Keep — it is required by accept criterion 4 (a reader must be able to tell when NOT to stack) and by criterion c4 in the goalplan. The plan listed the anti-patterns in `000_research.md` §4 but never routed them into shipped text; that was a plan gap. The table is the fix, and this section is its amendment record. |
| `dev/SKILL.md` table row gained "review scope" | Keep. `DEV-STACK-05` was added to the reference during the round-2 relocation, after this doc's table row was drafted; the row now describes the file's real contents. |

**Low — "too large to review in one sitting" is subjective (ACCEPTED, fixed).** The
criterion now defers to the repository's own review-size convention where one exists and
names reviewer judgment as the fallback, so the reader knows which authority decides.
