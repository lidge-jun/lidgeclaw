# Independent audit and roadmap close

Carson initial verdict FAIL: inherited binding line can bypass native corroboration;
status could silently fallback after schema validation failure. Both folded into010.
Reaudit: "No remaining blockers ... This approves the amended plan; implementation
and test execution remain unverified. VERDICT: PASS".
Docs-only roadmap complete; FSM still unbound (no fake transition). Implementation
begins against the audited010. Native helper/CLI/tests delegated as disjoint files;
main owns routing/status/documentation/dist and delivery. Existing state mutation
remains forbidden until the verified explicit bind command is available.

Integration caller search found payload-only dispatcher separate from root bin;
both now route session. Existing packed-install/platform smoke and payload-bin test
expected fabricated IDLE on missing files; they now assert the corrected nonzero
missing-state contract. Runtime text snapshots updated with the approved identity
recovery wording; no assertion was removed to hide an implementation defect.

Fresh Desktop0.153.4 app-server --stdio read-only hooks/list:24 codexclaw hooks,
6 SessionStart handlers, all enabled/trusted in both native current cwd and592d,
zero discovery warnings/errors. Existing daemon proxy initialize timed out25s;
no thread/start or turn/start sent, no hook execution was simulated. This rules out
current disk legacy-array/hash incompatibility, not a stale live-app snapshot.

Implementation review1a720d9: Kant found P2 terminal fallback provenance omitted.
Accepted: status now exposes selection=explicit/native/latest-file in JSON and
labels latest-file as an unverified terminal fallback in text. Regression asserts
native and fallback selections; no ID selection or mutation semantics weakened.

Reaudit PASS on status provenance interdiff; all three touched files (source/test/dist)
reviewed, no remaining actionable blockers. Focused rerun104passed0fail. Full remote
measurement on macmini archive:2646total,2642pass,3fail,1existing skip; all3 failures
require Git tracking metadata omitted by the archive transport. This is NOT a green
suite claim. Exact-head GitHub checkout CI is the full-suite acceptance; measured
total2646 feeds inventory. Build/platform/gate and core265focused tests passed.
Metadata bump changes only owned package versions/manifest/inventory; dependency
resolutions unchanged. Live bind preserved119 preexisting session hashes.

Git-bearing macmini clonee38115b closes all3 archive-only failures: packaging L19
4selected tests and dist-freshness F1 1selected test PASS. GitHub Linux full suite
passes on e38115b; other platform jobs pending. Current FSM recovery cycle entered
C, detected stale PATH command selection, then legally returned C->P for the scoped
resolver amendment. A direct B->P attempt was refused; no phase/reset bypass used.

Resolver amendment audit rejected unconditional payload preference because payload
`map`/`gui` are intentionally unavailable. Folded: command-aware dispatch using
existing exported COMMAND_TABLE; preserve legacy fallback for repo-only commands,
prefer owned dispatcher for supported recovery/FSM commands. No unrelated global
PATH mutation is used to conceal the mismatch.

Pre-resolver candidatee38115b exact-head GitHub CI completed SUCCESS on Linux,
macOS and both Windows line-ending modes. Packed install completed SUCCESS.
Final resolver candidateb464737 is separately reviewed/retested before a fresh
CI run; earlier-head green is not carried as final-head certification.
