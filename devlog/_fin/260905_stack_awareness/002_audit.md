# A audit and synthesis (archived)

Independent reviewer James (`01a07167-c3ee-7133-90d8-4725b324ecae`) read the plan, target sources and primary GitHub docs at baseline `01c2bc2a9676c112bd864aa8351d9a075455eabc`.

Fresh focused test: 17 passed, 0 failed/skipped; content gate exit 0. No writes/full suite. Separate context, inherited model; no model-family independence claimed.

Reviewer tail: `VERDICT: GO-WITH-FIXES (blockers=1)`.

1. Medium: native API merging needs async submission/polling, because legacy sync merge APIs do not support stacks and protection checks may fail after acceptance. Accepted. Root cause: existing prose only describes merge order, not eventual API outcome. Amended `010_implementation.md` to qualify the API path and add accepted-then-failed forward evaluation. No conflict with other findings; none rejected.

Main verdict: near-pass, sole blocker folded into the concrete plan before B. Global pointer reuse, non-mutation scope, runtime output tests and semantic review separation accepted by reviewer. No outstanding blocking residual.
