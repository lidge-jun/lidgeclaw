# Verification

2026-09-06, Node v24.17.0. Baseline: ba9fa32c.

- Existing map-affordance and goal-gate suites: 47 pass, 0 fail before changes.
- Extended assertions before implementation: exit 1, 4 expected failures (small
  workspace pointer, SessionStart/PostCompact pointer, compiled symlink CLI pointer,
  blocking-denial wording). Remaining permission-path assertions still passed.
- `node plugins/codexclaw/scripts/build.mjs`: exit 0, 156 files compiled, layout valid.
  Exactly the two expected tracked dist files changed.
- Two focused suites plus `plugins/codexclaw/test/dist-freshness.test.mjs`:
  exit 0, 48 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped. Existing test counts preserved.
- Docs/inventory gate and whitespace check: exit 0. New Interview link resolves.
- Direct compiled `cxc-ops/dist/cli.js hook session-start|post-compact` invocations
  in a temporary empty workspace: expected event names, exactly one 576-character
  question pointer in each output, no `.codexclaw` state directory created.
- Code review of goal-gate diff: only the denial string changed; exact-name guard,
  fail-closed lookup and decision branches remain unchanged. Async/legacy names
  pass through for active, inactive and unreadable goal status without DB access.

A review: Grok Hilbert, VERDICT PASS, no blocking issues; caller/hook/source/dist
paths confirmed. Main corrected PR base to `dev` from the repository workflow,
even though GitHub's default branch is `main`.

C review: fresh Grok reviewer Hubble, VERDICT PASS, no P1/P2 findings. Independently
reran the two suites (47 pass) and dist freshness (1 pass), confirmed both emitters,
main/child wording, native/host limits, identical source/dist and unchanged goal
permission branches. Test-first red remains the main agent's recorded observation.

Evidence limits: tests verify emitted guidance and existing permission boundaries,
not that every model obeys text or that a real async reply was delivered. No native
catalog, installed plugin cache, hook JSON, trust settings or Interview ledger changed.

Correction during0.2.18 integration: the PostCompact stdout observations above
did not prove model-context delivery. Native PostCompact accepts universal output
only. PR69's reviewed correction queues a scoped marker and emits once at the next
root UserPromptSubmit; see devlog/_plan/260906_release_0_2_18/011_repair_evidence.md.
This historical record is retained, not relabeled as a successful native delivery.
