# mvp_res Build Log — subagent authoring provenance

Status: PROVENANCE · 2026-06-30 · cxc
Purpose: record how the loop-ordered `mvp_res/` docs were produced, so the `000_INDEX.md`
"Subagent build provenance" reference resolves and future readers can audit grounding.

Archive note (2026-09-05): the owner removed the legacy `.omo/evidence/` receipts
from the current tree. References below describe historical artifacts; their originals
remain in [the pre-cleanup tree](https://github.com/lidge-jun/codexclaw/tree/6eccf0d4f7fc5e16c37ac141614cd156f675f111/.omo/evidence).

## Authoring model
- L-docs (010–310) authored by parallel **gpt-5.5** subagents over disjoint decade ranges, each
  grounded in the decade-themed source-of-record under `../260629_codexclaw_mvp/` plus live
  `codex-rs` / omo sources where cited.
- Research carried verbatim into `000_research_src/` (copies of 000/005/006/015/016/021.1/024.2/
  024.3/160 source docs).

## Decade range → source-of-record map
- 010–070 (L1–L7, DONE): 018*, 022.1, 023*, 024*, 025*, 027, 028*, 029*, 070*.
- 080–110 (L8–L11, Cluster 1): 080*, 022.2, 022.3, 023, 080.1.
- 120–190 (L12–L19, Cluster 2): 110_dev_skills_porting, 024.3.
- 200–220 (L20–L22, Cluster 3): 120_clijaw_command_mapping, 130_code_intelligence.
- 230–280 (L23–L28, Cluster 4): 030_phase2_overview, 031–035, 036_phase2_verification.
- 290–310 (L29–L31, Phase 3/defer): 040–044, 150_channel_delivery.

## Hardening passes (this goal: 45ab94c7-ba6)
- Pass 1 (Cluster 1, L8–L11): plan `pass1_P_cluster1_hardening.md`; A-gate audit by gpt-5.5
  reviewer (`.omo/evidence/cluster1-plan-audit-code-review.md`, verdict FAIL→fixed).
  - B (doc hardening): BUILD_LOG created, dangling `023_goal_creation_gate` refs fixed in loop
    docs, RESOLVED-as-status eliminated, L8–L11 schemas/caps/paths pinned (freeze manifest
    `.codexclaw/interview/freeze.json`, PreToolUse hook path pinned).
  - B (implementation, concurrent parallel session bitkyc08-arch):
    L8 interview state (`4c6fe9a`, `cf7db59`, `d544096`),
    L9 5-Mind dispatcher (`cee7ef8`) + A-gate blocker fix `e762a3c` (exact `correlationId`
    `<roundId>-<mindId>`, `isGroundedEvidence` validation, side-effect stripping) + DONE mark
    `b4bc75a`, L10 question gen + auto-mode triage + freeze manifest `0034850`.
  - C: doc acceptance criteria verified — BUILD_LOG exists, 0 dangling refs in loop docs,
    0 RESOLVED-as-status, freeze + PreToolUse paths pinned; tests green. L9 code-review evidence
    (`.omo/evidence/l9-…-code-review.md`) is a historical A-gate artifact; its blockers were
    closed in `e762a3c`.
  - D: Cluster 1 closed. L8/L9/L10/L11 all DONE. L11 goal-mode interview hard deny shipped:
    `goal-active.ts` (read-only native `goals_1.sqlite` lookup by thread_id, fail-closed on
    `unreadable`), `applyGoalModeInterviewGuard` PreToolUse deny for `request_user_input`
    (cli.ts + goal-gate.ts), I-trigger suppression in hook.ts, narrow matcher hook
    `pre-tool-use-guarding-interview-in-goal.json`. Tests: goal-active.test.ts +
    goal-gate/hook guard tests; 147/147 green.
- Pass 2 (Cluster 2, L12–L19): A-gate audit closed by `5b6dafe` (G1–G5: dead omo source root
  rewritten to repo-local `devlog/.lazycodex/plugins/omo/skills/`, L18 search → on-demand, L19
  dependency aligned, INDEX + scope targets fixed, L12 canonical porting rules). C-gate flip
  applied: L12–L18 ANALYZED→PLANNED (decision-complete: full Scope/IPABCD/Acceptance/QA/
  References/resolved Blocked-on), L19 stays BLOCKED(L12-L17); INDEX Cluster-2 rows match.
- Concurrent commit `4e6539f` (parallel session): status-legend expansion + search on-demand flip.
- Pass 3/4 parity sweep (Cluster 3 + Cluster 4, L20–L28): docs-only B correction recorded in
  `pass3_B_cluster3_4_parity_sweep.md`. Recent implementation/doc-close commits show L20-L28
  shipped; the sweep aligned stale sub-loop Status lines (L9.3/L9.4, L12.1-L17.3, L26.1/L26.2)
  to DONE, clarified that old `260629_codexclaw_mvp/` files are historical source inputs rather
  than current Status authority, and corrected L20.3 reset wording to match shipped scoped cleanup.
- Pass 4 final full audit: plan `pass4_P_final_full_audit.md`; independent read-only reviewer
  returned APPROVE with no blockers in `.omo/evidence/final-mvp-res-full-audit-code-review.md`.
  Reviewer verified INDEX status parity (L1-L28 DONE, L29-L30 DEFERRED, L31 planned/deferred),
  required template sections across L1-L28 loop/sub-loop docs, hook test split sizing, no
  unresolved dead-source path except historical/audit prose, `git diff --check`, targeted hook
  tests, and `npm test` 223/223. Final C-gate rerun completed: `npm test` 223/223 and
  `npm run build` OK (27 files compiled) before the evidence commit.

## Verification convention
- Component code: `node --test` (Node v24 native TS, no build toolchain); build via
  `node:module.stripTypeScriptTypes` aggregation. Current gate: 223/223 tests green.
