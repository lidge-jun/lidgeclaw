# License and artifact hygiene

Status: implementation and verification complete; archived 2026-09-05.

License selection superseded by the owner's MIT follow-up; see
[`010_mit_and_provenance.md`](010_mit_and_provenance.md). The cleanup remains unchanged.

User scope: continue removal of unused artifacts; change CodexClaw to AGPL. No
runtime refactor, release, install, Git history rewrite or third-party relicensing.
This is compact repository/documentation maintenance, not a new autonomous loop.

## Decisions and change map

- DELETE 35 unused files: `devlog/_fin/logo-{candidates,fusion,i2i-half,references}/`,
  `dev/references/v2-ultra-ab-diff.html`, and `architecture-analysis-report.md`.
  Inventory: 31.98 MiB. Searches of paths and filenames found no active runtime,
  packaging or docs-site dependency. Retain selected logos, applied assets and
  referenced QA/design evidence. Update selected-logo provenance links to Git history.
- Follow-up inventory found `devlog/_fin/260711_docs_site_upgrade/` contains only
  19 screenshots, no accompanying documents and no tracked references to the unit
  or sampled filenames. DELETE that orphan directory too; other media-bearing units
  have documentation and remain intact. Total cleanup: 54 files.
- MODIFY `.gitignore` with exact retired paths, not broad image or devlog exclusions.
- MODIFY root `LICENSE` to the verbatim GNU AGPL v3 text. NEW root `NOTICE.md`
  declares `AGPL-3.0-only`, retains the 2026 lidge-jun copyright, and preserves
  RepoMapper MIT and Aider Apache-2.0 notices. Do not rewrite vendored notices or
  dependency license metadata.
- NEW `plugins/codexclaw/{LICENSE,NOTICE.md}`: same documents in the actual
  marketplace payload, which does not include root files.
- MODIFY root `package.json`, only its root entry in `package-lock.json`, and
  `plugins/codexclaw/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`: `MIT` -> `AGPL-3.0-only`.
- MODIFY three README badges/license sections and docs-site manifest reference
  and SoftwareApplication license URL. Preserve third-party attribution.
- Extend the existing packaging artifact checks to cover tracked, identical root /
  payload legal files and matching first-party SPDX metadata; no new test-count row.

## Primary evidence (2026-09-05)

OMO `code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent` currently uses **SUL-1.0**, not AGPL, confirmed
by its default `dev` package.json and LICENSE.md via authenticated read-only API.
The user was told; follow the explicit AGPL request, without claiming an OMO match.
Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/dev/LICENSE.md

AGPL text obtained directly from https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt
(34,523 bytes), with verbatim-copy permission. Use version 3 only rather than
silently granting rights under unknown future licenses. This project declaration
does not replace separately licensed third-party material or retroactively revoke
licenses on earlier distributed versions.

## Verification / limits

- Source-to-payload license byte equality and exact SHA against the fetched GNU text.
- Focused packaging + vendored RepoMapper tests; check unchanged third-party files
  and dependency lock entries. No repository-wide local suite or new dependencies.
- `node plugins/codexclaw/scripts/gate.mjs`, staged diff, removal inventory and
  precise ignore checks. Code/deployment assets must be unchanged.
- Independent final review checks scope, metadata, payload inclusion and retained
  notices, not a legal opinion on every historical contribution.
- Commit cleanup and license changes separately, then push to the same requested
  `dev` target only if it is still a fast-forward. Do not promote main or release.

## Verification results

- Removed 54 unreferenced files totaling 36.88 MiB. Active site/plugin assets,
  selected logo originals and documented QA/design evidence were unchanged.
- Packaging/vendor checks: **14 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**; content gate and
  `git diff --check` passed. No repository-wide suite or runtime build was run.
- Root and payload AGPL text exactly match GNU's 34,523-byte source,
  SHA-256 `0d96a4ff68ad6d4b6f1f30f713b18d5184912ba8dd389f86aa7710db079abcb0`.
  NOTICE copies match. A `git archive HEAD:plugins/codexclaw` inventory includes
  both project legal files and the original vendor LICENSE/NOTICE.md.
- Only the root license entry changed in package-lock.json. Original vendor
  notices and dependency metadata were compared and remained byte-for-byte intact.
- Independent reviewer Carver (`01a0716c-4608-7041-a492-dd3e90e402a0`) inspected
  **70/70 changed files**, including all deletions, at `f13e1e6f..e5c065b` and reran
  the 14 checks and gate. **VERDICT: PASS**, no blockers. This is technical
  consistency/packaging verification, not a legal opinion on contribution rights.
