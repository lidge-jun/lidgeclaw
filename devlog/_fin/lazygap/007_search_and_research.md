# 007 — Search Engine + Deep Research

Gap class: FUNCTIONAL + HARNESS · evidence: explorer Plato

> omo's search strength is not prose — it is a bundled `engine/`, the R1-R7 harness, a
> `bias_check.py` CI gate, and ultraresearch's EXPAND/journal/claim-ledger protocol.
> codexclaw's `cxc-search` is a clean 3-tier ladder but thin on execution.

## Parity table — insane-search engine

| omo 실측 | codexclaw 실측 | 격차 | jaw식 보강 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ultimate-browsing/references/insane-search/README.md:15-35` + `engine/fetch_chain.py:91-177` + `engine/__main__.py` (R1/R2/R6: blocked URL -> single `python3 -m engine` entry; "200 is not success"; declare failure only after full grid) | `search/SKILL.md:23-45` (3-tier description) | omo binds blocked-URL handling to one executable harness; codexclaw describes tiers only | add a bundled `skills/search/engine/` (ast-grep-style no-server script) + a MUST rule: blocked URL routes to the single entry |
| `insane-search/README.md:78-119` + `jina.md` + `media.md` + `public-api.md` + `json-api.md` (Phase 0 official-API index: Reddit/HN/npm/PyPI/Bluesky/GitHub; Jina; yt-dlp) | `search/SKILL.md:25-39` (source-open proof principle, no API index) | omo says what backend to try first; codexclaw has no catalog | add `search/references/` for the official-API index + Jina/media/JSON-API recipes; wire priority into the skill body |
| `insane-search/README.md:35-58` + `playwright.md` (R7: on WAF + list-intent, run HTML grid in background while doing Playwright network recon -> internal JSON API) | `search/SKILL.md:31-38` (blocked-url reader mention) | omo has an API-first parallel branch; codexclaw does not | add R7-style API-first branch as a Tier-2 internal rule (browser network observe -> re-fetch); portable without a server |
| `insane-search/engine/bias_check.py:1-170` + `waf_detector.py` (No-Site-Name rule enforced by exit-code-1 CI gate) | `search/SKILL.md:14-21,52-74` (Source-Proof / Korean Intent Guard, prose only) | omo enforces no-hardcoded-site via CI; codexclaw guardrails are prose | if a `search/engine/` lands, add a `bias_check`-style denylist scan as an E8 gate |

## Parity table — ultraresearch

| omo 실측 | codexclaw 실측 | 격차 | jaw식 보강 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ultraresearch/SKILL.md:34-39,71-217` (first-line marker, authority override, `## EXPAND` tail, wave journal, claim-ledger, verified-claims) | `search/SKILL.md:40-45` (Tier 3 one paragraph) | omo has a deep-research operating system; codexclaw has a sentence | split Tier 3 into an `ultraresearch` reference (or skill): EXPAND/wave/journal/claim-ledger protocol |
| `ultraresearch/SKILL.md:119-166` (min first-wave workers, explore/librarian protocol, 2+ expansion waves, 3-no-lead / 5-wave cap) | `search/SKILL.md:40-45,76-81` (opt-in swarm + stop principle, no worker economics) | omo has convergence rules; codexclaw has none | add spawn-floor + 2-wave-minimum convergence to Tier 3 |

## Portability verdict (code-grounded)

insane-search is NOT a server — it's a skill-internal `engine/` module run as
`python3 -m engine "<URL>"` (`ultimate-browsing/SKILL.md:40,55,129`; `engine/executor.py`).
So it ports like `ast-grep`: a no-server bundled script skill. Split into three layers:
1. base (curl_cffi / Jina / official APIs / yt-dlp) — fully in-philosophy;
2. optional Playwright MCP handoff — session-tool dependent;
3. optional local Chrome fallback — needs Node/Chrome, opt-in.

## Steering-principle note

ultraresearch's roles (librarian/explore) do NOT become codexclaw roles. The deep-research
swarm runs as base `explorer` subagents with the research protocol/skill attached (`008`).

## Enforcement tier

Engine: E1-ish executable contract + E8 bias gate. Research protocol: E7 prose + E5
skill-attachment for the swarm.

## DECISION UPDATE (2026-06-30) — adapt agbrowse, do NOT port insane-search

Evidence: explorer Carson reading `../agbrowse/` against `cxc-search`.

> User decision (LOCKED): the insane-search engine port above is **superseded**. Do not
> port omo's `engine/`. Instead **adapt agbrowse** — cli-jaw's `browse` layer extracted into
> a standalone, server-free npm package (`agbrowse/README.md:31-32` states it directly).
> Rationale: agbrowse is already the no-server distillation we'd otherwise rebuild, MIT, one
> real dep (`playwright-core`), and HTTP-first with browser only as escalation.

### What agbrowse actually is

- `README.md:31-32`: no long-running MCP server; every command is a short-lived Node process
  that reconnects to CDP (`browser.mjs:965-989`), spawning Chrome detached only when needed
  (`browser.mjs:793-803`). This matches codexclaw no-server exactly.
- NOT self-contained per skill: `browser.mjs` is a hub importing `adaptive-fetch/*` and
  `web-ai/*` (`browser.mjs:64-93,80-83`); `search` lives at `skills/browser/search.mjs` and
  leans on `adaptive-fetch` (+ optional `web-ai` for `--deep`).
- `playwright-core` + Chrome are required only at the *browser* layer (`browser.mjs:992-1000`,
  `package.json:85-89`). `--verify` / adaptive-fetch try HTTP first and only escalate to a
  browser in `auto` (`adaptive-fetch/index.mjs:93-100,651-720`).

### Minimal adopt path (smallest dependency radius)

Not "port full agbrowse". Add an **agbrowse-proof helper + on-demand skill**:
1. Rewrite `cxc-search` Tier 2 *proof* to prefer `agbrowse search --verify <url>` /
   `agbrowse fetch <url>` before Browser Use (HTTP/public-endpoint proof first).
2. Resolve the `agbrowse` binary lazily, exactly like `ast-grep`
   (`ast_grep_helper.py:205-281`): runtime dir -> skill cache -> `PATH` -> install hint.
3. Keep Chrome as **optional escalation** (local CDP only — `EXTERNAL_CDP.md` remote/hosted
   modes stay out, they'd violate the no-server/local boundary).
4. Defer `web-ai` and `vision-click` (Codex CLI + heavy browser-runtime coupling).

### `cxc-search` Tier 2 text changes required

- "Open candidate URLs" -> "Prefer `agbrowse search --verify` / `agbrowse fetch` for proof
  before Browser Use".
- "Browser Use reads DOM/PDFs" -> "adaptive-fetch proves via HTTP/public endpoints first,
  then local CDP browser escalation when needed".
- `blocked-url-reader` helper -> re-scope from Browser-Use-only to "agbrowse/browser fallback
  tactics".
- Notes line "no `agbrowse` binary dependency" (`search/SKILL.md:87-89`) -> remove/correct;
  the dep is now opt-in/lazy, not forbidden.

### Adopt mechanism (pick at L25)

- **lazy global install** (ast-grep pattern) — best fit: no-server, opt-in, idempotent,
  `CODEXCLAW_AGBROWSE_PATH` override; cost = user-env version variance.
- bundle-copy — most stable but vendor-drift + manual updates.
- optional npm dep — easy updates but grows codexclaw's npm graph (currently lean).

### Net effect on the 007 plan

The "insane-search engine port (3-layer)" item in `009`'s L25 row is **replaced** by
"agbrowse adapt (lazy-resolved proof helper + Tier-2 rewrite)". ultraresearch *protocol*
(EXPAND/wave/journal/claim-ledger) parity above is unaffected and still rides as an
`explorer`-attached research skill (`008`).
