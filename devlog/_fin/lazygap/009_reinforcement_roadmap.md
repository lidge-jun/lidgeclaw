# 009 — Reinforcement Roadmap (synthesis)

Status: PLANNED (decision input; no code this pass) · evidence: 001-008

> Synthesis of the lazygap parity sweep into a priority-ordered reinforcement plan, each
> gap mapped to an enforcement tier (`structure/40_enforcement_methods.md`) and a proposed
> loop. The steering principle holds throughout: reinforce by skill attachment + hook
> surfaces, never by adding subagent roles.

## Priority matrix

| Rank | Gap (doc) | Tier | New surface? | Why this rank |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Subagent evidence gate (`002`) | E1 (SubagentStop block, VERIFIED `010`) | YES — SubagentStop (real) | biggest hole; makes every dispatch trustworthy; unblocks `008` |
| 2 | Skill-attached dispatch (`008`) | E3 on v1 + E5 on v2 (VERIFIED `010`) | YES — `^spawn_agent$` fires on v1 | the user's core ask; turns the rich `$cxc-*` family into real routing |
| 3 | Loop/goalplan state (`001`) | E2 + E8 | no (file) | substrate for work-aware Stop + quality gate |
| 4 | Stop continuation depth (`003`) | E2 | no | makes the loop actually know what's left; needs `001` |
| 5 | Compaction recovery (`006`) | E4 | YES — PostCompact | cheap, high-value resilience |
| 6 | Rules + edit checks (`004`) | E4 + E1 | maybe (edit PostToolUse) | discipline becomes runtime, not prose |
| 7 | Search engine + research (`007`) | E1/E8 + E5 | no (bundled script) | large but self-contained; ast-grep-style port |
| 8 | Code intelligence (`005`) | N/A | no | confirmed non-goal; discoverability nudge only |

## Proposed loops (extends the L14-L19 plan in mvp_hard/141)

| Loop | Decade | lazygap source | Slice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L15 | 150 | `008` | `SpawnPayload.items` + role/intent->skill map + builder routing |
| (within L15) | | `002` | SubagentStop evidence-receipt gate (the trust half of dispatch) |
| L17 | 170 | `003` honesty | loop/interview prose downgraded to match the hook |
| L21 | 210 | `001` | durable `.codexclaw/goalplan.json` + criterion evidence + quality-gate validate |
| L22 | 220 | `003` | work-aware Stop continuation on goalplan remaining tasks |
| L23 | 230 | `006` | PostCompact recovery hook |
| L24 | 240 | `004` | rule-injector + comment-lint PostToolUse |
| L25 | 250 | `007` | **agbrowse adapt** (lazy proof helper + Tier-2 rewrite) + ultraresearch protocol reference |
| L27 | 270 | `001` (orchestrator-internals addendum) | friction ledger (E1/E2 gate) + workspace-context dispatch path-hint + seed ontology schema |

> L15/L17 already exist in `mvp_hard/141`; `002` folds into L15 as its trust half.
> L21-L25 are the new lazygap-driven loops. Sequencing: `002`+`008` first (trust +
> routing), then `001`->`003` (loop substrate -> work-aware Stop), then `006`/`004`/`007`.
>
> L27 is the cli-jaw second-sweep loop (orchestrator-internals addendum in `001`). The
> friction ledger is the single new **runtime** gate (E1/E2) and the PostToolUse hook
> already exists, so it ranks high. The chat-search drift fix (memory addendum in `006`)
> was already resolved (301aa0b), so nothing remains to schedule for it.

## Enforcement-tier ledger (what becomes truly enforced)

- New SubagentStop hook -> E1 receipt block (`002`).
- New PostCompact hook -> E4 recovery directive (`006`).
- New edit PostToolUse -> E1 comment-lint block (`004`).
- `^spawn_agent$` input-rewrite -> E3 skill attach (`008`) on v1 (VERIFIED `010`); E5 builder
  fallback on v2 (`deny_unknown_fields` rejects `items`); hook fails open.
- goalplan validate + search bias gate -> E8 (`001`, `007`).
- Everything still prose-only today is E7 and must stop being called "enforced".

## Hard non-goals (carried from `structure/00_philosophy.md` §2)

- No LSP daemon / codegraph MCP / search server (`005`).
- No SessionStart auto-update / telemetry / provisioning (`006`).
- No new subagent roles — skill attachment instead (`008`).
- No goal-DB writes — goalplan state is project-local `.codexclaw/` (`001`).

## Open questions — RESOLVED (codex-rs verified 2026-07-01, see `010`)

1. `^spawn_agent$` PreToolUse matcher? **YES on v1** (`multi_agent_v1__spawn_agent` + default
   v2 canonicalize to `spawn_agent`); `updatedInput` may add `items`. **v2 is `deny_unknown_fields`
   and rejects `items`.** So `008` is E3 on v1 + E5 fallback on v2, hook fails open. Not "E3 vs
   E5" — both, by surface. (`010` Q2.)
2. `SubagentStop` fires for plugin-spawned children? **YES** — real event, fires on the child
   turn, stdin carries `last_assistant_message` + `agent_type`, `block`+`reason` forces
   continuation. `002` is confirmed **E1**, not doctrine. (`010` Q1.)
3. Evidence-receipt convention: **codexclaw's `--evidence`/`.codexclaw/evidence/`**, using omo's
   last-line `EVIDENCE_RECORDED: <path>` marker contract + realpath/symlink/non-empty guard.

> Bonus surface found: `SubagentStart` also exists (`010`), a future entry point to inject the
> attached-skill TASK contract at child-spawn time. Not scheduled.

## cli-jaw built-in tools — can we port them? (the original question)

> Not a lazycodex/omo comparison. cli-jaw's real tool surface is `bin/commands/` (37
> commands). codexclaw's is `cxc` (`bin/codexclaw.mjs`: enable/uninstall/status/doctor/
> reset/orchestrate/freeze/gui/subagents/provider) + the hook layer. The question is which
> cli-jaw commands can move into codexclaw's single-plugin, no-server model — and which are
> structurally bound to cli-jaw being a server + agent-CLI orchestrator.

Three buckets, grounded in what each command needs to run:

### A. Either SHIPPED as `cxc`, or HOST-NATIVE (Codex already provides it)

`cxc` today has exactly these subcommands (`bin/codexclaw.mjs:113-160`): `enable`,
`uninstall`/`disable`, `status`, `doctor`, `reset`, `orchestrate`, `freeze`, `gui`,
`subagents`, `provider`. The key reframe: cli-jaw needs `goal`/`project`/`skill`/`init`/
`hooks` because cli-jaw **is its own orchestrator** that spawns agent CLIs. codexclaw runs
**on top of the Codex runtime**, which already provides goal mode, cwd, skills, and hooks
natively — so these are not gaps codexclaw must fill, they are responsibilities the host
owns. The only `cxc` command codexclaw adds is for things Codex does NOT do (PABCD attest,
config enable, freeze handoff).

| cli-jaw command | who owns it in codexclaw | verified basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `orchestrate [P/A/B/C/D/status/reset]` | **`cxc` (SHIPPED)** — Codex has no PABCD, so codexclaw adds it | `cxc orchestrate` + attest gate (parity DONE, `001` addendum) |
| `doctor` | **`cxc` (SHIPPED)** | `cxc doctor` (`cxc-ops`) |
| `reset` | **`cxc` (SHIPPED)** | `cxc reset` (`cxc-ops`) |
| `goal [set/plan/status/update/done]` | **HOST-NATIVE.** Codex owns goal mode + the goal DB; codexclaw only *reads* `thread_goals` read-only and never writes it | `goal-active.ts` (reads `goals_1.sqlite`). A `cxc goal` command would duplicate the host and break the no-own-goal-DB rule |
| `project [set/list]` | **HOST-NATIVE.** Codex runs on `cwd`, so project-root is given by the runtime; no registry needed | the only residual is the subagent-dispatch path-hint/symlink nuance in `001` addendum, not a project-root registry |
| `skill` | **HOST-NATIVE.** Codex discovers skills from `plugin.json` + the skills dir and renders them; codexclaw's skills are already Codex-native `$cxc-*` entries | no `cxc skill` needed; `skill-hub` is just a routing skill, not a CLI |
| `init` | **Folded into `cxc enable`.** config-guard enable is the scaffold path | `config-guard/src/cli.ts:42` enable flow |
| `hooks` | **HOST-NATIVE.** Codex loads/dispatches hooks from `plugin.json`; codexclaw doesn't manage a hook registry | hooks fire via `plugin.json` registration; no `cxc hooks` CLI needed |

Honest summary of bucket A: codexclaw adds a `cxc` command only where Codex has no
equivalent (`orchestrate`/`doctor`/`reset`/`enable`/`freeze`). `goal`/`project`/`skill`/
`hooks` are **host-native** — the Codex runtime already provides them, so there is nothing
to port. `init` is covered by `enable`. The one genuine code item is the `001`-addendum
workspace-context path-hint for *dispatch* (not a project registry).

### B. Partial / reshaped (capability fits, mechanism changes)

| cli-jaw command | why it can't move as-is | codexclaw shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dispatch` / `worker` | spawn + monitor + session-resume of agent-CLI workers via a run-store | replaced by Codex `spawn_agent` subagents; no worker run-store/monitor (`001` addendum, by design) |
| `history` / `chat-search` | query the `messages`/thread index (server + SQLite) | host Codex owns thread search; codexclaw's own chat-search was retired (`006` addendum, drift fix) |
| `task` | durable task DB | mapped to host `update_plan` (decided in `mvp_res/201`), not a DB |
| `browser` / `browser-web-ai` | cli-jaw browse layer | **adapt agbrowse** lazily instead of reimplementing (`007` update) |

### C. Non-portable (structurally server / external-agent bound)

`serve` / `service` / `dashboard` / `dashboard-chat` / `dashboard-memory` (HTTP server +
federation), `memory` / `reminders` (server + index + scheduler), `employee` / `clone`
(persistent agent-CLI roster), `bgtask` / `launchd` (OS daemon/long-running tasks),
`connector` / `mcp` (MCP server management), `lock` (server-side concurrency), `provider`
(codexclaw keeps this **detect-only**, not management). These all assume cli-jaw is a
running server that spawns and supervises agent CLIs — exactly the boundary
`structure/00_philosophy.md` §2 rules out.

### Takeaway

Most of cli-jaw's command surface does not need porting at all: it exists because cli-jaw
is its own orchestrator, whereas codexclaw inherits goal mode, cwd, skills, and hooks from
the **Codex runtime** (bucket A host-native rows). codexclaw only adds a `cxc` command where
Codex has no equivalent (`orchestrate`/`doctor`/`reset`/`enable`/`freeze`). The genuinely
useful carry-overs are `browser`->agbrowse (`007`) and the orchestrator-internal discipline
(friction ledger / workspace-context path-hints / seed) which lands as **hook logic**
(`001` addendum), not new `cxc` subcommands. Bucket C is not a backlog; it is the no-server line.
