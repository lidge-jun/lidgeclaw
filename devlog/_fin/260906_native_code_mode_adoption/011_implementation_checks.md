# wp1 implementation and check evidence

Roadmap checkpoint c3313333; implemented candidate cf4115d2. Grok Russell's final
plan correction reread returned PASS, confirming all four findings were folded
and the map remained buildable with no hooks/config changes. The main agent had
entered wp1 B with the earlier near-pass and explicit accepted corrections; no
later PASS was invented as earlier evidence.

Changed nine files: dev/loop/pabcd entrypoints, native-execution and examples
references, peer/ownership pointers, native SOT and native-execution.test.mjs.
Shared policy is 77 lines and conditional examples 89 lines at cf4115d2. These
are source sizes, not measured token-cost reductions. Existing modules remain.

On macmini Node24.20.0, isolated /Users/junny/codexclaw-native-eval-01a0702d
at cf4115d2 fetched from a task-owned Git bundle:

`node --test plugins/codexclaw/test/native-execution.test.mjs plugins/codexclaw/test/packaging.test.mjs plugins/codexclaw/test/skill-catalog.test.mjs`

29 tests, 29 pass, 0 fail/cancel/skip; 592.953542ms. Gate and inventory checks
also exited zero. Baseline before the change was 8/8 package/catalog tests.
The new 21 tests exercise extracted trusted reference JS with controlled tool
responses; they do not implement or certify native V8/hooks/cancellation.
Negative controls include read rejection, failed/malformed/pending command result,
preview/upstream truncation, cache miss/invalid state, failed storage, hostile
strings as data and zero dependent writes after invalid/incomplete prerequisites.
In-memory mutants losing partial outcomes, bypassing prerequisites and converting
a cache miss to success are rejected by independent output/call-count oracles.

Local evidence copy: .codexclaw/evidence/01a0702d-c493-7510-801f-7d8772a2689c/
native-code-mode/codexclaw-native-eval-targeted.log. Product tests/builds were not
run on the local interactive machine. Full suite completed on exact cf4115d2:
2572 tests, 2571 pass, 0 fail/cancel, 1 existing optional repo-map skip,
73531.215917ms. Build exited zero and compiled component diff is empty.
Measured count synchronization is reserved for wp2 before PR submission.

Independent fresh implementation reviewer Harvey (Grok-4.6 high),
01a074c1-f3f4-7822-ac93-b8fdf12329f0, reads the nine-file diff; verdict pending.
No speedup, universal routing adoption or security enforcement claim follows.

Current C native observations (actual functions.exec, not shell Node): the exact
discovery/read-batch/cache-read fence contents were submitted as raw JS. Discovery
found exec_command and exposed its schema. Both literal Git reads completed;
the next cell loaded the previews with freshEvidence:false, while typeof commands
was undefined and a distinct missing key returned undefined. A side-effect-free
yield_control call returned running cell ID68; functions.wait on that exact cell
returned the remaining completed output. No process/agent handle was substituted.
These confirm only the current host/session; no hook denial or forced cancellation
was exercised. They do not prove models voluntarily prefer Code Mode when direct
tools are also exposed, or that all hosts expose the same helpers.

Harvey reviewed all nine changed files and returned GO-WITH-FIXES: one medium
test-evidence gap and three low findings, no high/critical control-flow defect.
Main accepted all: full retained-envelope assertions for failure/malformed cases;
keep available exit/session/error/truncation metadata when output is missing;
assert exact evidence argument in successful/rejected write callbacks; remove
the meaningless VM lexical-isolation assertion. Actual native isolate observation
above remains separate. Example output adds toolError, consumed in stored reads
and cache-preview output; no new persisted product schema or runtime consumer.
The reviewer was interrupted once to conclude from gathered evidence after a long
read-only pass, not instructed to approve. Follow-up reviews use the exact interdiff.
