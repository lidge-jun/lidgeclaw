/**
 * text-lines.ts - one newline idiom for the whole repo.
 *
 * `split(/\r?\n/)` is right for display and tool output and wrong wherever byte
 * offsets or lengths are recorded: it consumes two bytes and leaves no way to
 * tell that it did, so a CRLF ledger's recorded lengths come out short by one
 * byte per line (opencodex usage/log.ts:782-786). Both idioms are named here so
 * a call site has to choose on purpose.
 *
 * SHARED-HELPER-01: copied verbatim into every consuming package rather than
 * imported across a package boundary. Components in this repo are dependency-free
 * of each other, so a `../../` specifier would not resolve at build time.
