/**
 * source-gate.ts — entry refusal for goalplan-bound cycles whose source identity
 * cannot be resolved (#133).
 *
 * WHY AT ENTRY: the C->D gate (check-gate.ts) and `receipt test` (receipt-cli.ts) both
 * refuse an `unavailable` identity, and that refusal is correct — CHECK-BINDING-01 is
 * fail-closed and 075_receipt_binding.md forbids reading "I do not know" as
 * "unchanged". But B->C is deliberately fail-open ("no git means no opinion"), so a
 * bound session sails P->A->B->C and only discovers at C that it can never close.
 * Plan, audit and implementation are already spent, and there is no exit. This gate
 * moves the same verdict to the cheapest possible point.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it never tests for `.git`. The predicate is "the SOURCE identity
 * is unavailable", so binding a git source worktree (#109) clears it without this file
 * knowing anything about split cwds. Written the other way, this gate would reject the
 * #109 case at the door and that fix would have to undo this one.
 *
 * Unbound sessions are untouched: they close D on checkOutput + exitCode and never
 * enter the receipt path. Callers must only consult this for a BOUND session.
