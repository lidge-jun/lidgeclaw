/**
 * triage.ts — auto-mode severity triage + assumption transition (L10.2 / 102).
 *
 * Converts L9 contradictions into either a user question (high severity, manual
 * interview) or a recorded assumption (low/medium). Pure functions: callers own
 * the actual request_user_input call and state write.
 *
 * Policy (FROZEN 102):
 *  - low    -> recorded assumption (conservative)
 *  - medium -> recorded assumption by default
 *  - high   -> user question (manual interview); CANNOT be safe-defaulted
 *  - goal-mode backfill: a high gap becomes a high-severity assumption requiring
 *    user review (goal mode cannot ask).
 *  - rhythm guard: after 3 consecutive auto-resolves, the next contradiction is
 *    escalated to the user regardless of severity.
 *  - an auto-resolved contradiction moves contradictions[] -> assumptions[]
 *    (recorded:true) only AFTER it is written into `## OPEN ASSUMPTIONS`.
