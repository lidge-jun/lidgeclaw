/**
 * hook.ts — pure hook logic (no process IO; stdin/stdout handled by cli.ts).
 *
 * UserPromptSubmit: detect an explicit IPABCD/interview trigger in the prompt
 * and inject the matching phase directive as additionalContext. Idempotent per
 * (session, turn): a turn_id is recorded in state.injectedTurns so a re-fired
 * hook in the same turn does not double-inject.
 *
 * Stop: active under a native goal only. It returns a bounded
 * `{decision:"block",reason}` continuation envelope while a PABCD cycle is in flight —
 * or, since 260709 (GOAL-IDLE-CONTINUE-01), while an ACTIVE goal is parked with no
 * in-flight cycle (arming nudge). It releases on: no active goal, phase I, context
 * pressure, or the same-phase stagnation cap (the single total-termination bound now
 * that the old unconditional `stop_hook_active` release is gone).
 *
 * Ground truth:
 *  - payload field names: codex-rs hooks/src/events/{user_prompt_submit,stop}.rs (snake_case)
 *  - output shape:        omo rules/src/hook-output.ts:10-16 (camelCase hookSpecificOutput)

 * the current phase. This resets ONLY that cursor so the first NON-SUPPRESSED same-phase
 * prompt upgrades to the FULL phase directive (mode-2: `phase !== lastInjectedPhase`).
 *
 * It does NOT touch phase, flags, the stagnation counter, the goalplan, or the goal DB, and
 * it does NOT bypass the context-pressure suppression (which correctly runs first) — so it
 * does not guarantee re-inject on the immediately next prompt, only that the first eligible
 * one is the full directive. Returns "" always: PostCompact output cannot inject context
