/**
 * evidence-cli.ts — `cxc evidence resolve` (EVIDENCE-TERMINAL-01, 260826).
 *
 * When a delegated worker exhausts its evidence-verification budget, the SubagentStop
 * gate releases it (a child that cannot write the receipt gains nothing from being
 * asked forever) and records an unresolved tombstone. GOAL-COMPLETE-GATE-01 then
 * refuses to certify the goal until that verdict is settled. This is how a parent
 * settles it.
 *
 * Resolution is EVIDENCE-BACKED, not an acknowledgement: `--receipt` is required and
 * is validated through the same `hasValidReceipt` contract the gate itself uses
 * (inside .codexclaw/evidence, not a symlink, a regular non-empty file). A bare
 * "I acknowledge this" would just relocate the laundering it exists to prevent.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO `--override` flag. A CLI flag cannot authenticate a human:
 * the same agent that GOAL-COMPLETE-GATE-01 is holding back could run it, erase its own
 * verdict, and then certify the goal — which is precisely the laundering this gate
 * exists to stop. The honest escape hatch for a genuine external blocker already
 * exists and is host-owned: `update_goal {status:"blocked"}`, which the gate always
 * allows.
