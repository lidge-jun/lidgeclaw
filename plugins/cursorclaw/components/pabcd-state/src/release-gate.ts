/**
 * release-gate.ts — MLB 1.0 exact-head evidence gate (issue #21).
 *
 * Defines the machine-readable candidate manifest schema that links every
 * required receipt for an MLB 1.0 release. Does not create another runtime
 * subsystem — it consumes the other tracks.
 *
 * Schema v2 (260815 release train) adds the fields that make the gate FAIL CLOSED
 * rather than merely describable:
 *  - receipt capturedSha/capturedAt, so a receipt earned on another commit is stale
 *    rather than silently reusable;
 *  - testSuite, so a release cannot ship beside a red or foreign-commit suite;
 *  - inventoryHash + publishedCounts, so a fresh test receipt cannot sit next to a
 *    stale public badge (the exact drift that made v0.1.0 misdescribe the product).
