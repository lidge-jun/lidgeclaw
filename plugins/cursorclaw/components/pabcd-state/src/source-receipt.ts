 * source-receipt.ts — source-bound evidence receipts (WP11 / plan 030).
 *
 * A final gate that only checks "a receipt file exists and is non-empty" cannot
 * tell whether the tree moved after the tests ran. These receipts carry the
 * SourceIdentity captured when the evidence was produced, so the gate can
 * compare it against the tree at completion time.
 *
 * Fail-closed: every rejection returns { error }, never a partially trusted
 * object and never a throw. Throwing would land in the caller's outer catch,
 * which fails open by design for genuinely unexpected errors.
 *
 * Honest limit: the receipt writer fills in its own sourceIdentity, so this
 * detects "the tree moved since the evidence was produced", not "the evidence
 * was really produced".
