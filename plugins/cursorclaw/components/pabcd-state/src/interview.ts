/**
 * interview.ts — IPABCD interview tracker schema, bounded fail-closed reconstruct,
 * and the readiness predicate (L8 / 080-083, FROZEN).
 *
 * The tracker records how complete the Interview (I) phase is across four
 * dimensions. `isInterviewReady` is the single source of truth the main session
 * uses to derive `flags.interview` (which gates entry to P). User transition
 * requests cannot override a false predicate.
 *
 * Discipline (T2/T3/T6):
 *  - T2: every in-state array is capped (MAX_TRACKER_ARRAY, drop-oldest) so the
 *    hot session JSON stays small; no external ledger ships in Cluster 1.
 *  - T3: malformed/lossy data reconstructs FAIL-CLOSED — invalid dimension level
 *    -> "low", invalid confidence -> 0, legacy/invalid assumptions -> recorded:false,
 *    so corrupted data can never become a ready tracker.
 *  - T6: round/edit ids are carried so later loops have a replay horizon beyond
 *    the 50-turn injection cap.
