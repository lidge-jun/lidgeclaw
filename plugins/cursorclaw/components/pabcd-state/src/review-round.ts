/**
 * review-round.ts — round lifecycle for plan audits and final gates (WP10 / plan 010).
 *
 * A->B today accepts a pasted reviewer verdict and the main agent's own call, so
 * approving a plan, editing it, and then entering B on that approval all passes.
 * Provenance is unprovable, but round identity and the plan hash are locally
 * checkable facts, and this module makes them durable.
 *
 * Pure: every function takes a Goalplan and returns a new one. No file IO — the
 * caller reads the plan document and computes its sha256, and the caller persists
 * the result with writeGoalplan.
 *
 * This slice ships the state machine only. Wiring it into the A->B attest gate
 * needs the CLI to exist first; turning the gate on before then would demand a
 * `review-round open` that nobody can run.
