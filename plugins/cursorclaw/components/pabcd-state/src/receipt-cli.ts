/**
 * receipt-cli.ts — `cxc receipt test` (075).
 *
 * Runs a command and records what happened. The point is that the agent does not
 * choose the numbers: exitCode and command are observed here rather than typed
 * into an attestation. That only holds for receipts this producer wrote — the gate
 * cannot authenticate provenance, so a hand-written file is still possible.
 *
 * Source identity is captured before AND after the run with the same exclusion the
 * C>D gate uses. Capturing once would mark the receipt stale the moment it is
 * written, and a command that rewrites tracked files (a formatter, a snapshot
 * update) has no business closing a check with the tree it just changed.
