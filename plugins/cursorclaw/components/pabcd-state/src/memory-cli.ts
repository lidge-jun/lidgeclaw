/**
 * memory-cli.ts — `crc memory allow-write` (MEMORY-WRITE-GATE-01, 260909 wp1-A).
 *
 * The operator-issued half of the gate's authorization. The other half reads the
 * user's own prompt, which is the right default but is unavailable to a script, to a
 * replayed automation, or to a subagent (UserPromptSubmit no-ops on child turns —
 * cli.ts:339-341 — so a delegated worker is otherwise always denied). This command
 * is how those callers say yes ONCE, on the record.
 *
 * The grant is single-use: the gate spends it on the next memory write. A standing
 * "always allowed" flag would be the surface the gate exists to close, so there is
 * deliberately no such flag and no `--force` on the write itself.
 *
 * There is no `--revoke`, because an unspent grant is cleared by the write it
 * authorizes and a session state file is removable directly.
