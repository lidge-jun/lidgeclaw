/**
 * goalplan.ts — project-local durable goalplan substrate (lazygap_impl 030).
 *
 * `$cxc-loop` is a prose contract today: "work-phase = one PABCD cycle, D closes to
 * IDLE, the agent self-advances." Nothing durable records WHAT the work-phases are,
 * which criteria gate completion, or what evidence each produced. This module gives
 * that prose a backbone: a slug-namespaced plan artifact + an append-only ledger.
 *
 * Hard invariants (LOCKED — see structure/00_philosophy.md):
 *  - codexclaw NEVER writes the host goal DB. The `host` link here is PROVENANCE only:
 *    `host.armed` records that the MAIN session armed a goal at the freeze boundary; no
 *    code in this module ever calls create_goal / writes goals_1.sqlite.
 *  - All state is project-local under `.codexclaw/goalplans/<slug>/`.
 *  - readGoalplan returns null (never throws) on absent/unreadable — callers degrade,
 *    never trap a session.
 *  - The coupling to the Stop loop is one-directional and loose: a goalplan ENRICHES a
 *    Stop block reason when a host goal is active; it never ARMS the loop by itself.
 *
 * Pure shaping + direct node:fs IO (consistent with state.ts / freeze.ts; no fs seam).
