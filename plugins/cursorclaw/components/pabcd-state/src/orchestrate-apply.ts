/**
 * orchestrate-apply.ts — HUMAN (chat) free-pass transition application (L3b / 031).
 *
 * The invocation-source split (codexclaw has no boss token): a command that arrives
 * via UserPromptSubmit is HUMAN-driven and gets a free-pass — forward transitions
 * advance WITHOUT requiring an attestation. The L2 adjacency invariant still holds
 * (illegal edges are refused); only the attest *evidence* requirement is waived for
 * the human. The agent path (L4 `cxc orchestrate` CLI) keeps the un-weakened
 * `transition()` with `validateAttest`, so this helper never touches `transition()`.
 *
 * Pure: returns the next State + an optional LedgerEntry for the caller to persist.
