/**
 * deactivate.ts — revert exactly what codexclaw turned on, per key.
 *
 * The old gate hashed the WHOLE config.toml and refused to revert anything when the
 * file had changed at all. codexclaw is not the only writer of that file (the user
 * edits it, codex writes it, opencodex writes it), so one unrelated edit after install
 * disabled uninstall permanently — leaving flags the user never chose enabled forever.
 *
 * Now each item is judged on its own: revert when our value is still there, leave it
 * when someone else changed or removed it. The whole-file hash survives as a REPORTED
 * signal (`fileDrifted`), and it still gates the one destructive case — removing a key
 * whose priorValue was null — because value equality on a boolean is one bit of
 * provenance, not proof that we wrote it. There the activation backup has to agree.
 *
 * Order matters (and is load-bearing): table-key restores happen FIRST as one
 * read-modify-write, then the flag pass runs `codex features disable`. That CLI
 * rewrites config.toml from a fresh read, so it preserves our write; the reverse order
 * would clobber it. It also means a broken `codex` can never strand a managed key.
