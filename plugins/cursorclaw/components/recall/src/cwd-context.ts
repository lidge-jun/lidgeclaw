/**
 * cwd-context.ts — enumerate recent sessions for ONE working directory.
 *
 * The hook used to find sessions by searching chat text for basename(cwd), which
 * only matches when the directory name happens to appear in the conversation. Hash
 * worktree names ("1fa9") essentially never do, so those checkouts got no context
 * at all. The sidecar index already stores cwd per file, so sessions can be listed
 * directly: no text match, no FTS, and one indexed lookup per session for the
 * opening user message.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort and READ-ONLY. A missing or unreadable index
 * yields null so the caller can fall back to the previous search path.
