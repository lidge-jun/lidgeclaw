/**
 * hook.ts — Recall hooks: SessionStart/PostCompact context injection +
 * UserPromptSubmit recall-intent nudge.
 *
 * SessionStart & PostCompact: inject a CWD-scoped summary of recent work so the
 * agent starts every session (and recovers after compaction) already knowing what
 * happened in this project. Uses the sidecar FTS index for speed (< 200ms).
 *
 * UserPromptSubmit: when the user's prompt references past work (Korean or English
 * recall idioms) and no recall command is already present, inject a short directive
 * pointing at `cxc chat search` / `cxc memory search`.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN: any parse/shape problem yields empty output (no injection).
 * Envelope parity with pabcd-state buildContextOutput (CRLF normalize, trim,
 * 32k cap — this directive is far below the cap).
