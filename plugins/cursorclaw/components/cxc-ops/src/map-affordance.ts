/**
 * map-affordance.ts — SessionStart `cxc map` discoverability injector.
 *
 * WHY: `cxc map` (the repo-map skill) is only routed from the `dev` skill's §1.5
 * (DEV-MAP-FIRST-01), which is model-autonomous — the model only learns the tool
 * exists if it reads that skill. This hook uses one of the four real enforcement
 * surfaces (SessionStart additionalContext, philosophy §1) to make the tool's
 * existence known at session start, WITHOUT injecting the map body itself (that
 * whole-repo preload is the deliberately-rejected non-goal — see lazygap 005 and
 * 260706_repo_map: on-demand only, no session-start map injection). This injects a
 * POINTER, not the map.
 *
 * SIZE GATE: a repo-map overview only pays off once a tree is big enough that
 * `rg`-walking to reconstruct structure is costly. Below the threshold the
 * affordance is silent (a tiny repo does not need a map). The count is a cheap
 * bounded source-file walk (skips vendored/build/VCS dirs, caps traversal).
 *
 * SAFETY: SessionStart is read-only; compact recovery writes only a scoped hint
 * marker, never FSM/goal state. Always exit 0. On any doubt (unreadable cwd,
 * walk error) it emits nothing rather than a broken envelope — a missing
 * affordance is strictly better than a failed session start.
