/**
 * atomic-write.ts - publish-by-rename with a bounded win32 retry.
 *
 * POSIX `rename(2)` replaces the destination unconditionally. Windows fails with
 * EPERM/EACCES/EBUSY while a scanner, indexer, or sync client holds a transient
 * handle on the target - which is routine here, because hooks fire concurrently
 * (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse all touch session state).
 *
 * The envelope is sized for a scanner blinking, not for a file someone actually
 * has open: two retries at 25ms and 50ms. A longer wait would turn a hot-path
 * hook into a visible stall, and a file genuinely held open is a real error that
 * should surface (opencodex `windows-atomic-replace.ts:1-18`).
