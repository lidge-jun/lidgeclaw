# Codexclaw Architecture Reference

> codexclaw 프로젝트의 구조 허브. Start here for the single-plugin shape, the Codex runtime boundary, component responsibilities, skills/hooks/CLI surfaces, and the `.codexclaw/` state model.
>
> Planning state lives under `devlog/_plan/`: `mvp_res/` is the shipped MVP source-of-record, while `mvp_hard/` is the parity-hardening track.

## structure/ SOT 파일

This directory is the maintainer source of truth for the current system shape and the
design philosophy behind it (opencodex-style flat SOT). `INDEX.md` is the "what is
where" hub; the numbered files carry the durable reasoning.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md) | Architecture hub: component/skill/hook/CLI/state map (this file). |
| [`00_philosophy.md`](00_philosophy.md) | Implementation philosophy: boundary invariants, the model-autonomy vs runtime-enforcement tension, truthfulness regime, HITL/HOTL split, subagent doctrine. |
| [`10_subagent_skill_routing.md`](10_subagent_skill_routing.md) | L14 design SOT: attaching `cxc-*` skills to subagent spawns + loop/goal handoff hardening. |
| [`20_pabcd_dispatch_doctrine.md`](20_pabcd_dispatch_doctrine.md) | PABCD + dispatch + routing operating doctrine inherited from cli-jaw, translated to a serverless plugin. |
| [`30_contradiction_register.md`](30_contradiction_register.md) | Truth table of doc↔code contradictions (claim vs reality, file:line), the input to L14 + any status-sync gate. |
| [`40_enforcement_methods.md`](40_enforcement_methods.md) | Enforcement ladder E1-E8: how strongly each intent can be enforced given the four Codex hook surfaces, and which tier to pick per contradiction. |
| [`50_emergence_gap.md`](50_emergence_gap.md) | Why PABCD is a convergence (exploitation) machine with no divergence/plateau surface — the structural weakness on emergent/algorithmic tasks (NYPC 3.5/8 diagnosis), with an honest E-tier fix taxonomy. |
| [`60_native_capabilities.md`](60_native_capabilities.md) | Live-verified Codex native capability matrix (browser/computer use, deferred V1 collab tools, catalog/flag-selected V2, lifecycle equivalents, `update_plan`, `view_image`, `imagegen`, flag-gated CSV fan-out) and the per-skill gap map the WP-N track patches. |

Writing rule: keep this directory flat. Add or extend lexicographically ordered
`NN_topic.md` files (`00-09` philosophy/foundations, `10-19` subagent/routing, and so
on); do not nest subfolders. When code and SOT disagree, fix the code or amend the SOT
in the same change — never leave them silently divergent.

codexclaw is a **single Codex plugin**, not a server. It reuses the OpenAI `codex` runtime and layers cli-jaw-style development discipline onto Codex through skill mentions, hooks, file state, subagent prompts, and the `cxc` CLI. There are no jaw employees, no boss token, no external orchestrator server, and no plugin-defined `/` slash commands; `/` commands live in the Codex runtime, while codexclaw's discovery surface is `$cxc-*` skills plus hook-triggered context injection. The one scoped exception is the opt-in loopback messenger bridge (`cxc serve`, `00_philosophy.md` §2): a relay to stock `codex exec`, not an orchestrator.

opencodex (`ocx`) is adjacent but optional. opencodex is a local provider proxy that can inject `model_provider = "opencodex"` into Codex config and serve `/v1/responses`; codexclaw only detects `ocx` status through `provider-bridge` and never vendors or auto-configures opencodex.

## Component Map

### `components/config-guard`

Controlled activation for the Codex features codexclaw needs. `src/features.ts` declares `multi_agent`, `goals`, `hooks`, and soft `default_mode_request_user_input`; it parses `codex features list` output by exact feature name. `src/activate.ts` backs up `config.toml`, enables only missing declared flags through the official `codex features enable`, and writes `.codexclaw-install.json` (manifest v2) under Codex home. `src/deactivate.ts` reverts per item: a flag or managed key goes back only when codexclaw set it and that value is still live, and anything an external writer changed or removed is left to its current owner. The whole-file hash is reported as `fileDrifted` rather than obeyed — codexclaw is not the only writer of that file, so the old blind-revert refusal disabled uninstall after any unrelated edit — and it still gates the one destructive case (removing a key that did not exist before install), which additionally requires the activation backup to corroborate. `src/toml-edit.ts` owns the component's TOML table/key grammar and the setter for keys `codex features` cannot reach; `src/managed-keys.ts` holds that whitelist, each entry carrying its own `autoEnable` decision so installation writes only the keys that earned it. The boundary between the two vocabularies is not the TOML table name but whether the switch means anything without codexclaw: `DECLARED_FEATURES` are flags codexclaw needs to function, and install plus SessionStart self-heal turn those on; `CONFIG_MANAGED_KEYS` holds switches whose effects reach past codexclaw (`memories.dedicated_tools` changes the whole memory pipeline), so an entry there is auto-enabled only on its own evidence and otherwise stays an explicit `cxc config set`. `memories.dedicated_tools` is auto-enabled since 260909: the PreToolUse memory write gate (`pabcd-state/src/memory-write-gate.ts`) supplies the precondition its caution named, and `activate.ts` records the pre-install value in `tableKeys` so `cxc disable` restores it exactly. `src/self-heal.ts` is the SessionStart call site: it enables a declared SOFT flag that is off, at most once per key (`healedKeys`), records the heal as codexclaw-owned in the manifest so `cxc disable` can revert it, and opts out permanently once the user runs `cxc disable`. `src/cli.ts` is the production binding that resolves `CODEX_HOME` / `~/.codex` and shells out to `codex`.

### `components/cxc-ops`

Local operations that do not require a codexclaw server. `src/doctor.ts` checks manifest parseability, hook file presence and trust-hash drift, skill metadata, agent TOMLs, MCP config drift, and optional ast-grep availability. `cxc hooks retrust` repairs reported hook drift with a timestamped config backup, atomic write, and hash-algorithm safety-pin. `src/reset.ts` removes only scoped `.codexclaw/` working state: `--state`, `--generated`, or `--all`. `src/cli.ts` dispatches `doctor`, `hooks retrust`, and `reset` (unknown subcommands print usage and exit 0). The former `chat-search` wrapper was retired (D1', mvp_hard L13/WP1): Codex app-server `thread/search` has no native CLI/agent surface, so wrapping it made codexclaw a self-implemented search surface; public-web lookups route through the `cxc-search` skill. Past-session recall was later re-scoped by owner directive (2026-07-02, `devlog/_fin/260702_codex_recall/`): the `recall` component reads Codex-native disk artifacts directly — a different mechanism than the retired app-server wrapper, which stays a non-goal.

### `components/messenger-bridge`

Loopback bridge for the dashboard and messenger agents. `src/cli.ts` dispatches `serve` and `service`: `serve` opens the project-scoped bridge DB, creates the HTTP server on `127.0.0.1`, starts enabled adapters through `BridgeController`, and shuts down the scheduler/controller/server/DB in order; `service` installs, uninstalls, or reports a macOS launchd daemon for `cxc serve`. `src/server.ts` serves the built GUI plus JSON API routes (`health`, compatibility, connect/manage, agents), with local Host and mutating-request guards. `src/db.ts` owns `.codexclaw/bridge.db` via `node:sqlite`, including channels, allowlists, bindings, jobs, named agents, and migrations. `src/agent-service.ts` serializes per-binding Codex turns, records jobs, persists thread ids, and terminates active child processes on shutdown.

### `components/recall`

Read-only recall search over the Codex session root (`CODEX_HOME`, default `~/.codex`); never writes. `src/rollout.ts` walks `sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` with directory-date pruning, classifies main vs subagent rollouts from the `session_meta` first line (grow-until-newline head reads survive 40KB meta lines), filters harness-injected synthetic user messages, and extracts message + tool-log entries. `src/chat-search.ts` runs AND-default (OR with `--any`) case-insensitive word matching with file-level prefilter, exact per-message `--days` cutoff, cwd/role/source filters, context windows, and a truncation warning at the 200-cap limit. `src/threads-db.ts` enriches hits from the `threads` table (title, git branch) via a lazily-required read-only `node:sqlite` handle, degrading to a warning when unavailable. `src/memory-search.ts` paragraph-scans `memories/**/*.md` plus `stage1_outputs` in `memories_<N>.sqlite` with md/db thread dedupe. `src/cli.ts` dispatches `[chat|memory, "search"|"index", ...]` (jaw-style text or `--json`).

WP2 sidecar index: chat search is served by default from a rebuildable derived cache at `$CODEXCLAW_HOME ?? ~/.codexclaw` + `/recall/index.sqlite` — the one codexclaw surface that is user-level rather than project-local `.codexclaw/`, because sessions span all projects (`devlog/_fin/260702_codex_recall/20_wp2_index.md`). `src/index-db.ts` owns the schema (msgs content table + trigger-synced `msgs_fts` unicode61 and `msgs_tri` trigram external-content FTS5 tables; version drift drops and rebuilds). `src/ingest.ts` re-ingests only files whose (mtime,size) changed, prunes vanished files, and caps tool outputs at 8KB. `src/index-search.ts` compiles the WP1 filter set to SQL — trigram MATCH for >=3-char words (substring semantics, CJK-capable), LIKE fallback below — with refresh-on-query keeping results live (measured: full build 1,533 files/326k msgs in ~161s once; queries ~20-40ms full-history vs 2-16s scans; ~2.1GB disk). `--scan` forces the JSONL path; index failure degrades to scan with a warning; `~/.codex` stays read-only either way.

### `components/pabcd-state`

The IPABCD file-state engine and hook logic. `src/state.ts` owns `Phase = "IDLE" | "I" | "P" | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D"`, `.codexclaw/sessions/<sessionId>.json`, and `.codexclaw/ledger.jsonl`. `src/fsm.ts` defines `nextPhase()`, legal entry checks, attest-gated A->B and C->D flag flips, and D->IDLE cycle close. `src/hook.ts` emits scoped phase hints without natural-language phase entry, leaves transitions to explicit user commands or authorized agent CLI calls with existing guards, injects compact stage headers through `additionalContext`, and runs bounded Stop continuation for active-goal work, including arming blocks at IDLE when no cycle is in flight. Post-answer rescan guidance independently respects scope; answer capture and readiness remain separate mechanisms. `src/goal-gate.ts` handles PreToolUse denials for budgeted `create_goal` calls and goal-mode `request_user_input`. `src/cli.ts` is the hook stdin/stdout process and `freeze` / `orchestrate` command entry.

Supporting files include `attest.ts` for evidence validation, `parse.ts` for hook payload parsing, `interview.ts` / `minds.ts` / `triage.ts` for interview readiness and contradiction support, `transcript.ts` for transcript-tail idempotency, and `freeze.ts` / `freeze-cli.ts` for freeze manifest handling.

### `components/provider-bridge`

opencodex detection, not opencodex management. `src/detect.ts` resolves whether `ocx` is on PATH and parses read-only `ocx status --json` into `provider`, `native`, or `error` status. `src/cli.ts` is the SessionStart hook / manual detect entry. It explicitly does not run `ocx ensure`, `ocx sync`, mutate Codex config, or fail the Codex session when ocx is absent.

### `components/skill-search`

External skill-catalog discovery. Searches the jaw (cli-jaw-skills, first-class default),
ClawHub, and Hermes catalogs so a capability that is not installed can still be found and
loaded on demand via `cxc skill search` / `cxc skill show`. Read-only against remote catalogs;
the adapter preamble applies on load and `cxc-dev` discipline wins on conflict.

### `components/subagent-config`

Per-role subagent model, reasoning-effort, and prompt configuration. `src/store.ts` reads/writes `.codexclaw/subagents.json` atomically for `explorer`, `reviewer`, `executor`, and `architect`, defaulting each role to the main Codex model with inherited effort (`effort: null`; valid overrides are the catalog-supported values low/medium/high/xhigh). `src/catalog.ts` builds a selectable model catalog from the native Codex cache allowlist plus optional ocx-backed model ids, with native models first. `src/mcp.ts` serves a stdio MCP server with `subagents_get`, `subagents_set`, and `catalog_list` tools.

---

## Skills Map

codexclaw skills live under `plugins/codexclaw/skills/`. Their `agents/openai.yaml` `interface.display_name` values are the user-facing `$` autocomplete names; folder names are implementation paths. The implicit-visible set is `{dev, search, interview, pabcd, recall, loop, dev-frontend, dev-uiux-design}` (`dev` alone carries always-on body discipline). All other `dev-*` routers and the remaining skills are on-demand and explicitly invokable.

| Skill display name | Folder | Role |
|--------------------|--------|------|
| `cxc-dev` | `skills/dev/` | always-on development discipline: classifier, modularity, verification, safety |
| `cxc-pabcd` | `skills/pabcd/` | Codex-native IPABCD workflow discipline |
| `cxc-interview` | `skills/interview/` | explicit I-phase entry and continuous contradiction-interview contract |
| `cxc-orchestrate` | `skills/orchestrate/` | explicit phase-control surface for chat and the live agent-gated `cxc orchestrate` CLI |
| `cxc-loop` | `skills/loop/` | HOTL repeated work-phase continuation contract |
| `cxc-goalplan` (deprecated, redirects to `cxc-loop`) | `skills/goalplan/` | durable goalplan/checkpoint/quality-gate contract |
| `cxc-dev-architecture` | `skills/dev-architecture/` | module boundaries, circular deps, coupling, validation placement |
| `cxc-dev-backend` | `skills/dev-backend/` | API/server/database/backend operations guidance |
| `cxc-dev-data` | `skills/dev-data/` | pipelines, ETL/ELT, SQL, schema/data quality |
| `cxc-dev-debugging` | `skills/dev-debugging/` | root-cause debugging method |
| `cxc-dev-frontend` | `skills/dev-frontend/` | UI/frontend implementation |
| `cxc-dev-uiux-design` | `skills/dev-uiux-design/` | design judgment, UX states, logos/typography |
| `cxc-dev-testing` | `skills/dev-testing/` | test strategy, QA, CI gates |
| `cxc-qa` | `skills/qa/` | manual surface-driving QA gate: evidence matrix, adversarial classes, teardown receipts |
| `cxc-dev-code-reviewer` | `skills/dev-code-reviewer/` | review verdicts, findings, risk assessment |
| `cxc-dev-security` | `skills/dev-security/` | auth, secrets, validation, supply-chain/security review |
| `cxc-dev-devops` | `skills/dev-devops/` | containers, deploy, IaC, SRE/release surfaces |
| `cxc-dev-scaffolding` | `skills/dev-scaffolding/` | project/module scaffolding and structure audits |
| `cxc-search` | `skills/search/` | current/public lookup ladder and Korean search intent guard |
| `cxc-recall` | `skills/recall/` | past-session chat/memory recall before asking the user to repeat context |
| `cxc-skill-hub` (deprecated, redirects to `cxc-dev`) | `skills/skill-hub/` | on-demand skill catalog router |
| `cxc-ast-grep` | `skills/ast-grep/` | AST-aware search/codemods using `sg` |
| `cxc-repo-map` | `skills/repo-map/` | ranked repo structure map (vendored RepoMapper: tree-sitter tags + PageRank) |
| `cxc-lunasearch` | `skills/lunasearch/` | cheap parallel public-web discovery lane that hands proof back to `cxc-search` |
| `cxc-worktree-guardian` | `skills/worktree-guardian/` | Codex-app managed-worktree identity safety: adopt-in-place renaming, never delete/recreate, WORKTREE-GUARD-01/02/03 hook interplay |
| `cxc-dev-visualizer` | `skills/dev-visualizer/` | render and inspect Mermaid/diagram artifacts |
| `cxc-kwrite` | `skills/kwrite/` | Korean long-form writing and revision protocol |
| `cxc-remote` | `skills/remote/` | remote host execution and workload routing |

The `dev` hub routes by change surface toward on-demand `dev-*` skills. `skill-hub` documents the exposure model: `allow_implicit_invocation` controls auto-rendered skill visibility, while explicit `$skill` / path mention still works unless a skill is disabled. The `interview`, `orchestrate`, `loop`, and `goalplan` skills are discoverable contracts for hardening surfaces; their deeper runtime work is tracked in `devlog/_fin/mvp_hard/`.

Stack awareness (`DEV-STACK-06/07`) belongs to `skills/dev/references/stacked-prs.md`,
not exclusively to DevOps. The existing cxc-ops SessionStart/PostCompact envelopes
expose a bounded pointer in every workspace. The agent inspects native membership and
CI on demand; the hook does not query GitHub, classify the repository, load skills,
register stacks or change checks. DevOps remains on-demand and points to the same owner.

---

## Hooks

The manifest wires 22 hook JSON files; `plugin.json` `hooks` and `hooks/*.json` are both authoritative and locked by `checkCounts`. Seven earlier advisory hooks were retired to `hooks/_deprecated/` in the 2026-07-05 hook diet (their rules were absorbed into the `dev` skill family).

| Hook event | Hook file | Command | Live behavior |
|------------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `SessionStart` | `hooks/session-start-ensuring-provider-bridge.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/provider-bridge/dist/cli.js" hook session-start` | emits one ocx status JSON line; detect-only |
| `SessionStart` | `hooks/session-start-announcing-map-affordance.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/cxc-ops/dist/cli.js" hook session-start` | size-gated map pointer plus global skill/loop/stack/background guidance; pointers only, no GitHub lookup |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `hooks/user-prompt-submit-checking-pabcd-trigger.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js" hook user-prompt-submit` | detects explicit IPABCD triggers and injects phase context |
| `Stop` | `hooks/stop-checking-pabcd-continuation.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js" hook stop` | active only under a native goal + in-flight PABCD cycle; bounded by re-entry, IDLE/no-goal, context-pressure, and stagnation guards |
| `PreToolUse` `^create_goal$` | `hooks/pre-tool-use-guarding-goal-budget.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js" hook pre-tool-use` | denies `create_goal` inputs with keys other than `objective` |
| `PreToolUse` `^request_user_input$` | `hooks/pre-tool-use-guarding-interview-in-goal.json` | same pabcd-state CLI | denies user-input/interview tool use while native goal mode is active or unreadable |
| `PostToolUse` `^request_user_input$` | `hooks/post-tool-use-capturing-interview-answers.json` | same pabcd-state CLI | captures interview question/answer events to the ledger; in an interactive I-phase also reinjects the Mind-rescan directive as `additionalContext` (L18); never blocks |
| `SubagentStop` `^worker$` | `hooks/subagent-stop-verifying-evidence.json` | same pabcd-state CLI | verifies worker evidence expectations on subagent stop |
| `PreToolUse` spawn/collaboration variants | `hooks/pre-tool-use-attaching-skills.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/subagent-config/dist/spawn-attach-hook.js" hook pre-tool-use` | normalizes cxc mentions and inlines recognized skill bodies on plaintext V2-shaped spawns; when no body can be inlined (including encrypted native V2), appends a plaintext `[CXC-SKILL-AFFORDANCE]` child self-load instruction; also applies model+effort routing plus leaf guards on both surfaces and never adds missing skills |
| `PostCompact` | `hooks/post-compact-resetting-reinject-cursor.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js" hook post-compact` | resets reinjection cursor/stage context after compaction |
| `PreToolUse` `^(apply_patch|Write|Edit)$` | `hooks/pre-tool-use-linting-apply-patch.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js" hook pre-tool-use-edit` | combined edit path: comment lint (deny-capable) then IDLE-edit arming advisory |
| `PostToolUse` `^(view_image|browser:control-in-app-browser|chrome:control-chrome|computer-use:computer-use|apply_patch)$` | `hooks/post-tool-use-tracking-render-observations.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js" hook post-tool-use-render-observation` | tracks render/visual observation events for QA evidence |
| `SessionStart` | `hooks/session-start-bootstrapping-pabcd-state.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js" hook session-start` | materializes the bound session's default IDLE FSM state; side-effect only, silent |
| `PreToolUse` `^update_goal$` | `hooks/pre-tool-use-guarding-goal-complete.json` | same pabcd-state CLI | denies `update_goal complete` while a cycle is in flight or the bound goalplan fails E8 |
| `SessionStart` | `hooks/session-start-injecting-recall-context.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/recall/dist/cli.js" hook session-start` | injects CWD-scoped recent-work recall context |
| `PostCompact` | `hooks/post-compact-injecting-recall-context.json` | same recall CLI | re-injects recall context after compaction |
| `PostCompact` | `hooks/post-compact-injecting-bg-terminal-affordance.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/cxc-ops/dist/cli.js" hook post-compact` | restores background-terminal, loop and stack guidance after compaction |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `hooks/user-prompt-submit-detecting-recall-intent.json` | same recall CLI | detects past-session recall intent and injects the recall search affordance |
| `SessionStart` | `hooks/session-start-detecting-managed-worktree.json` | `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js" hook worktree-guard` | injects the WORKTREE-GUARD-01 identity block when the session cwd is inside an app-managed worktree ($CODEX_HOME/worktrees or CODEXCLAW_WORKTREE_ROOTS) |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `hooks/user-prompt-submit-guiding-worktree-rename.json` | same pabcd-state CLI, `hook worktree-guard` | on worktree rename intent inside a managed worktree, injects the adopt-in-place guidance once per session (WORKTREE-GUARD-02) |
| `PreToolUse` `^Bash$` | `hooks/pre-tool-use-guarding-managed-worktree-deletion.json` | same pabcd-state CLI, `hook worktree-guard-pretool` | denies commands that delete the session's own managed worktree (git worktree remove / rm -r of slot, checkout, cwd, or ancestors) — enforced for subagent turns too (WORKTREE-GUARD-03) |

Hook processes are intentionally short: read stdin JSON, reconstruct state, optionally write `.codexclaw/`, then print either nothing or one JSON hook envelope. `UserPromptSubmit` outputs `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`; `PreToolUse` can output `permissionDecision: "deny"` with a reason. Non-PreToolUse errors fail open to avoid blocking Codex; the goal-mode `request_user_input` guard is fail-closed.

## Quality Gate (E8)

`plugins/codexclaw/scripts/gate.mjs` (run via `npm run gate`, enforced by
`plugins/codexclaw/test/gate.test.mjs` so `npm test` fails on drift) holds three checks:

- `checkStatusSync`: every `mvp_hard/000_INDEX.md` ledger row's **decision-state** must equal
  the leading `Status:` token of its loop doc (the two-axis legend, `132_L13.2`, makes the
  loop-doc leading token the decision axis; parentheticals express impl and are not parsed).
  Status tokens are a LOCKED enum (`DONE|FROZEN|PLANNED|ANALYZED|DEFERRED|BLOCKED|PROPOSED|PARTIAL`).
  Rows decomposed inside a shared doc (L15/L16/L17 → `141`) are allowlisted in `NO_OWN_DOC`.
  L20 has its own loop doc (`200_L20_gap_register.md`) and is validated directly, not allowlisted.
- `checkForbiddenClaims`: NARROW false-enforcement phrases in `skills/**/SKILL.md` (e.g.
  "hook automatically loads the X skill") are violations unless the line carries a trailing
  `<!-- gate-ok: <reason> -->` escape for a genuinely hook-backed claim.
- `checkCounts`: the `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` `hooks[]` length must equal the number of
  `hooks/*.json` files (locks C7).

Test-script asymmetry (C9): the root `package.json` `test` glob is the single source of test
discovery; it already globs every component `test/` dir. Component packages do NOT each carry a
local `test` script by design — the root glob covers `provider-bridge`/`subagent-config` even
though they have no package-local `test` script. This asymmetry is intentional, not drift.

## CLI Surface

`package.json` exposes both `codexclaw` and `cxc`, with `cxc` as the preferred short alias. `bin/codexclaw.mjs` is a small delegator. It owns the top-level agent-oriented help contract: `cxc help`, `cxc --help`, and `cxc -h` print grouped usage and recovery notes, while unknown top-level commands exit non-zero with a `cxc --help` hint.

| Command | Delegates to | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| `cxc enable` | `components/config-guard/dist/cli.js enable` | activates declared Codex feature flags; a soft flag that cannot be enabled warns on stderr with its impact and recovery commands |
| (SessionStart hook) | `components/config-guard/dist/cli.js hook session-start` | `src/self-heal.ts` turns on any declared SOFT flag that is off, once per key, cached on `config.toml` mtime; fail-open and silent unless something changed |
| `cxc uninstall` / `cxc disable` | `components/config-guard/dist/cli.js disable` | reverts only flags codexclaw enabled when safe |
| `cxc status` | `components/config-guard/dist/cli.js status` | prints declared feature enabled/disabled state |
| `cxc doctor` | `components/cxc-ops/dist/cli.js doctor` | plugin health report, including drifted/untrusted hook evidence |
| `cxc hooks retrust` | `components/cxc-ops/dist/cli.js hooks retrust` | recomputes and records hook trust hashes with a timestamped backup, atomic write, and algorithm safety-pin |
| `cxc reset` | `components/cxc-ops/dist/cli.js reset` | scoped `.codexclaw/` cleanup |
| `cxc chat-search` | RETIRED (D1', L13/WP1) | removed; native `thread/search` has no CLI/agent surface = non-goal; use `cxc-search` |
| `cxc chat search` | `components/recall/dist/cli.js chat search` | read-only recall over `~/.codex` rollout JSONL (owner re-scope 2026-07-02; not the retired app-server wrapper) |
| `cxc memory search` | `components/recall/dist/cli.js memory search` | read-only search over `~/.codex/memories` + `stage1_outputs` |
| `cxc gui` | `plugins/codexclaw/gui` via `npm run dev` | starts the Vite dashboard when deps exist |
| `cxc orchestrate` | `components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js orchestrate` | agent-gated terminal phase control over the same `.codexclaw/` session files; supports `help`/`--help`/`-h`; explicit-session text output includes current phase context |
| `cxc freeze` | `components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js freeze` | freezes the interview plan + writes the goal-activation handoff manifest at `.codexclaw/interview/freeze.json` |
| `cxc metric` | `components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js metric` | records/shows objective metrics for emergence-harness loops |
| `cxc divergence` | `components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js divergence` | records divergence mode and candidate archive state |
| `cxc loop` | `components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js loop` | initializes, shows, or validates the project-local goalplan substrate |
| `cxc goalplan` | `components/pabcd-state/dist/cli.js goalplan` | deprecated alias for `cxc loop` |
| `cxc subagents` | `components/subagent-config/dist/cli.js` (list/get/set) | reads/writes the per-role `.codexclaw/subagents.json` model+effort+prompt config |
| `cxc provider` | `components/provider-bridge/dist/cli.js` (detect) | read-only ocx provider detect/status; never mutates provider state |
| `cxc serve` | `components/messenger-bridge/dist/cli.js serve` | runs the loopback bridge server for the GUI, JSON API, and messenger adapters |
| `cxc service` | `components/messenger-bridge/dist/cli.js service` | installs, uninstalls, or reports the macOS launchd daemon for `cxc serve` |
| `cxc map` | `skills/repo-map/scripts/repomap.py` via bootstrap ladder (env override > `uv run` > `~/.codexclaw/venvs/repomap` > bare `python3`) | ranked repo structure map; first skill-owned Python subcommand — vendored upstream script, so no TS component/dist build; `--help` bypasses the ladder (dep-free); degrades to an install hint without Python deps |

`cxc reset` is an ops cleanup command for `.codexclaw/` state/generated files. `cxc orchestrate reset`
is the PABCD phase reset command; keep the two meanings distinct when writing docs or tests.

## State Model

Runtime project state is file-based and rooted at the working directory:

```text
.codexclaw/
  sessions/
    <sessionId>.json
  ledger.jsonl
  subagents.json
  interview/
    freeze.json
  interviews/
    <sessionId>.jsonl
```

`sessions/<id>.json` follows the `State` shape from `components/pabcd-state/src/state.ts`: `phase`, `sessionId`, `slug`, `updatedAt`, `flags`, `supersededBy`, `injectedTurns`, `lastInjectedPhase`, `orchestrationActive`, and `interview`. Reads are strict reconstruction: unknown fields are dropped, invalid phase values fall back to default state, and the interview flag is derived from the normalized interview tracker.

The phase enum is `IDLE/I/P/A/B/C/D`. `IDLE` is the closed/rest state. `I` through `D` are work phases. `D` is a transition phase that closes the current work-phase back to `IDLE`; it is not the resting state. In `fsm.ts`, `nextPhase(D)` returns `IDLE`, while `nextPhase(IDLE)` returns `null` because callers choose the next entry explicitly.

`ledger.jsonl` is the append-only audit-trail target exposed by `appendLedger()`. Chat and CLI
phase transitions append transition entries; the Stop hook itself only blocks/releases for
continuation and does not append ledger spam on every Stop event.

`subagents.json` is owned separately by `components/subagent-config/src/store.ts` and stores role-level model/effort/prompt selection. It is not part of the PABCD phase session JSON.

`interview/freeze.json` is the per-session interview-plan freeze manifest written by `cxc freeze` (`components/pabcd-state/src/freeze.ts`); on a plan-hash mismatch the plan must be re-frozen before proceeding. `interviews/<sessionId>.jsonl` is the append-only Interview ledger shared by the `PostToolUse` Q/A capture hook and the contradiction-scan evidence rows (`components/pabcd-state/src/interview-ledger.ts`, `state.ts`).

---

## Subagents

Native architect registration is owned by
`components/subagent-config/src/role-registration.ts`: `cxc subagents register architect`
explicitly publishes its canonical prompt and read-only sandbox configuration, with
managed-file preservation. The shared registrar also supports executor. Registration
omits model/effort pins; architect CXC settings remain independent. Verify a fresh
session exposes architect before dispatch; no explorer/reviewer alias fallback.

Subagent role TOMLs live under `plugins/codexclaw/agents/`: `explorer`, `reviewer`, `executor`, and `architect`. They are canonical prompt sources, not auto-registered plugin roles. Codex plugin manifests expose `skills`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, and apps; codexclaw uses inline prompt injection for its existing `explorer`/`worker` mappings and explicit registration for the independent native `architect` role.

| Role | Codex `agent_type` | Writes | Purpose |
|------|--------------------|--------|---------|
| `explorer` | `explorer` | no | read-only codebase investigation with file evidence |
| `reviewer` | `explorer` | no | adversarial plan/diff review with PASS/FAIL blockers |
| `executor` | `worker` | scoped yes | bounded implementation inside an assigned write scope |
| `architect` | `architect` | no | design proposals and executable-plan reflection; main owns decisions |

The subagent config component selects per-role model, effort and prompt overrides; default mode inherits the main Codex model. Architect attaches the existing `dev` and `dev-architecture` skills. Formal P and changed-decision rechecks follow `skills/pabcd/references/phase-plan.md`, `phase-audit.md` and `delegation.md`; these are agent-followed instructions, not new runtime enforcement.

## Planning Tracks

`devlog/_fin/mvp_res/` is the canonical shipped MVP ledger. It records L1-L28 as DONE, including state engine, directive hook, goal gate, dev router skills, subagent roles, install activation, provider bridge, subagent config, model catalog, and GUI subagent page. L29-L31 are deferred/planned future work.

`devlog/_fin/mvp_hard/` is the parity-hardening lane after the MVP. It documents the gap between codexclaw's current `$cxc-*` + hook UX and cli-jaw/jawcode-style explicit PABCD phase control. Its locked constraints are important: no codex-rs fork, no plugin slash commands, no external orchestrator, file-based state only.

The L14 hardening design (subagent skill routing + loop/goal handoff) has largely shipped: its
root-cause diagnosis lives in `devlog/_fin/mvp_hard/140_L14_loop_goal_routing_followup.md`, its
fix shape is the design SOT at [`10_subagent_skill_routing.md`](10_subagent_skill_routing.md), and
the work landed across L14-L19 (all `DONE | DONE`) — including the E5 spawn-attachment builder (L15),
the E3 PreToolUse mention normalizer (L15.2), and the forward `GOAL_ACTIVATION_DIRECTIVE`
bridge (`cxc freeze`). One piece stays deferred by design: the **reverse** goal-active auto-arm path
("set a goal → loop runs" without a separate orchestrate trigger). The most recent lane is **L20**,
the L1-L19 full-span gap-remediation loop (`devlog/_fin/mvp_hard/200_L20_gap_register.md`).

## Boundary Rules

- codexclaw is loaded by Codex; it does not replace Codex.
- codexclaw hooks append context or deny tool calls; they do not swallow/replace user prompts.
- codexclaw state is project-local `.codexclaw/`, not a jaw server database; user-level
  `~/.codexclaw` may hold rebuildable derived caches only (recall FTS index, ast-grep runtime).
- `ocx` is optional provider infrastructure; codexclaw's provider bridge is detect-only.
- `$cxc-*` names are skill mentions/autocomplete; they are not slash commands.
- `cxc` is a local CLI alias for plugin ops, not a server API.
